# Lavender

What does it feel like? As a little mole living under the ground of a hillside covered in lavender?
They were enveloped in the scent of flowers all day, with blissful expressions on their faces. 
Joyful children would roll down the hill in the moonlight, captivated by the gentle slope. Lavender 
was in full bloom, soothing the mole mom's migraines, and she had been sleeping soundly of late. So, 
the mole dad was in a great mood, sipping lavender-infused wine, getting ever drunker. He already 
had poor eyesight, and now his olfactory world was entirely dominated by the fragrance of lavender. 
With the added effect of intoxication, he might not even find his way home when he went out.

Among this group of adorable little moles who seemed to be in heaven, there was one young mole who 
appeared to be troubled. Unlike the other moles, he didn't spend his summer days sleeping in the 
cool burrow. Instead, he roamed around in the bright sunlight. What was he searching for?

This story dates back to a few months ago, during spring when the lavender had not yet bloomed, 
and the hills were still covered in lush green grass. During that time, the mole mom gave birth 
to several baby moles, his little brothers and sisters. Among them, there was one baby mole who 
looked different from the rest, she was pure white. He asked his mom and dad, but they had no 
idea why. Apart from her fur and skin being a little whiter, luckily, she was a healthy baby. 
The mole mom didn't worry too much because as long as her children were healthy, she was content.
However, the young mole was still curious about his little sister. Besides taking care of his 
siblings, just like any other older brother would, he also brought her pretty little flowers and 
stones.

The baby moles, as newborns, had no sight, and they usually relied on their strong sense of smell
to navigate and recognize each other. Until recently, their vision had gradually matured. Suddenly, 
the mole sister realized that she looked different from her family, but they didn't mind at all. 
In fact, their indifference comforted her greatly. She especially liked staying close to her big 
brother, which made some of her other siblings slightly jealous.

About a month ago, these little moles left the burrow for the first time to explore the outside
world and meet other mole families living in the area. "Oh my, look at that! Who is it?" "White?
Is that a little white mouse?" The appearance of the mole sister sparked a lot of discussion among 
the moles. Some were bold enough to get closer and have a look or even try to touch her fur, just 
to see if she was a real mole. "She's moving!" "Is she really a mole?" Suddenly, facing such 
attention from the group, the mole sister felt extremely nervous. She turned around and hurried 
back into the burrow, refusing to come out again.

The lavender scent, which can be comforting when one feels sad. But all the lavender over the hill 
couldn't alleviate the sadness within the white mole sister. Ever since that day, she didn't want 
to venture outside anymore. Her mom and dad took turns consoling and encouraging her, assuring her 
that if she showed a little more bravery and resilience, everyone would see that she was just a 
lovely mole like them. Her other siblings had gradually made new friends and were spending less 
time with her. Even her brother, who had always been by her side, had started spending more time 
away from home.

The white mole sister often lingered at the entrance of their burrow, peering outside. The blue sky,
white clouds, dark night sky, green grass, purple lavender, her deep grey fur, and herself, as white
as the clouds – these were all the things she could see. She had many times contemplated stepping 
out to see more of the world, to be accepted by the community, to overcome the fear of becoming a 
burden to her family, to prevent them from becoming the subject of ridicule, and to keep them from 
giving up on her. As her worries multiplied, her self-confidence dwindled. Her parents thought, 
perhaps she just needed a little more time.

But as time passed, and she stayed at home more often, her courage to step outside diminished even 
further. Then, after several days of absence, her mole brother returned. When she saw him, she rushed
into his arms. Her brother noticed how much thinner she had become and sighed softly. He asked her to 
close her eyes and held something small out to her, asking her to guess what it was. The little moles 
heavily relied on their sense of smell, so her immediate response was, "It's lavender, what's there 
to guess?" Her brother replied, "Now open your eyes and take a look." In his hand was a small petal, 
a lavender petal, pink as his palm.

The white mole sister was astonished, and amidst her surprise, a feeling of joy bubbled up inside her.
Was this real? Or was her brother performing magic tricks? She was hesitant to trust her eyes, but as
she leaned closer to take a sniff, she knew for sure—it was indeed a lavender petal, pink as his palm.
She asked, "How did you turn this lavender petal this color?" Her brother said, "This particular 
lavender plant has entirely pink blossoms! They're naturally pink when they bloom!"

The little sister was overwhelmed with emotion, feeling like an invisible weight had been lifted from 
her heart. Suddenly, the world felt broader, and she believed she could fly. In a world where pink
lavender existed, why couldn't there be a white mole like her? She embraced her brother again, and
tears of joy flowed uncontrollably. She had made up her mind; she would go out and search for that pink
lavender.

The next summer, a small patch of lavender, grown in the shape of a heart, appeared on the hillside. 
If you looked closely, you would see a pure white mole, playing with her companions under the moonlight, 
rolling down the lavender-covered hill, following its gentle slope, all the way from the hilltop.
