# Garlic And Chives

## Chapter 0  

2:00 PM, at the docks. Two sailors were unloading cargo from a truck.  

“What the hell is in this box? It’s so heavy.”  

“Some kind of specialized electronic equipment, I heard. Expensive stuff, so be careful.”  

“By the way, is that guy really so capable? My uncle said he didn’t do a thing but already demanded three million upfront and another two million as a final payment. Don’t you think our boss is getting scammed?”  

“Shh, keep it down. He’s right up there watching. The guy’s making money off his skills. He is a smart weirdo.”  

On the second floor, a curly-haired young man in his twenties leaned against the railing, smiling mischievously.  

## Chapter 1  

8:00 PM, dusk. A black SUV arrived punctually.  

Small suitcase in hand, Xiao A stood by the roadside outside her home, waiting for the vehicle to come to a complete stop. Inside the suitcase were essentials for a weekend trip to her friend’s place in T City, 100 kilometers away. After confirming the vehicle’s arrival on her phone, she loaded the suitcase into the trunk and approached the rear passenger door.  

The window was rolled down, and Xiao A noticed two passengers already in the back—a man and a woman seated far apart, seemingly strangers. The young woman in the back right seat wore a mask. Seeing this, Xiao A decided to try the front passenger seat instead. It was unoccupied. She opened the door, got in, and fastened her seatbelt.  

The man in the driver’s seat wore a low-brimmed cap and was staring intently at his phone. Once Xiao A was settled, the car pulled away from the residential area. The cabin remained eerily silent.  

All trips were optimized by the system. Even though the passengers didn’t know each other or each other’s destinations, the vehicle’s programming would drop everyone off at their designated locations in sequence. As the SUV moved through the city, wind gusted in through the rear window. The car wasn’t going fast, so it wasn’t unbearable, but Xiao A felt tempted to ask the woman in the back seat if she could roll the window up a bit. However, the oppressive quiet in the car discouraged her. The silence made her hesitant to speak, as if her voice might shatter it. She decided to endure it until they hit the highway.  

Once the car merged onto the intercity expressway and reached a speed of 80 kilometers per hour, the windows automatically rolled up, and the cabin’s air purifier and ventilation system kicked in. The smooth acceleration and braking of the autonomous vehicle provided a sense of security, eliminating concerns about fatigued driving. Xiao A put on her headphones and an eye mask, planning to listen to her favorite podcast during the one-to-two-hour journey. The latest episode of *SwitchOn* was about covert cameras and recording devices, and how the booming deepfake industry had spawned an intricate web of black-market activity.  

The other three passengers were equally silent, absorbed in their respective smart devices. In this age of heightened surveillance concerns, where micro-cameras and listening devices were prevalent, trust among strangers was fragile. Nobody could be sure if the person sitting next to them was a voyeur or if a chance encounter was a meticulously planned scam.  

Without warning, a long, resounding fart broke the silence in the back seat.  

The air soon filled with an unmistakable stench—a pungent mix of garlic and chives.  

The young woman in the back couldn’t hold back and muttered under her breath, “This is unbearable,” pinching the top edge of her mask and shifting closer to the door as if trying to merge with it. She attempted to open the window, but it was locked, requiring a system request to unlock.  

The young man, clearly embarrassed, bristled at her reaction but said nothing. Xiao A, who was equally overwhelmed by the smell, stretched out her hand to increase the ventilation fan speed, only to find that the system was stuck in recirculation mode.  

Feeling nauseous and desperate, Xiao A glanced upward and noticed the manual handle for the sunroof. Weakly, she pointed at it.  

Irritated, the young man snapped, “Seriously? Is it that big of a deal? Stop being so dramatic.”  

His words shattered the uneasy silence like a stone through glass.  

The young woman in the back snapped back, “Oh, shut up! Your breath already reeks of garlic. I smelled it the moment I got in. Do you want it to stink even more?”  

She unbuckled her seatbelt, stood up, and reached for the sunroof handle. However, her long acrylic nails hindered her efforts, and she couldn’t get it open.  

Seeing her struggle, Xiao A unbuckled her seatbelt despite the alarm beeping incessantly. She held her breath and reached out to help.  

The young man, visibly annoyed but also somewhat resigned, grumbled, “Fine, I’ll do it!” He unbuckled his seatbelt, stood up, and yanked the sunroof open.  

The car was instantly filled with the rush of wind, the chime of seatbelt alarms, and the laughter of two young women gasping for fresh air.  

The man muttered complaints under his breath as Xiao A and the young woman exchanged relieved glances, laughing uncontrollably.  

The ice broken, conversation flowed more easily. Xiao A explained how she’d been sensitive to the smell of chives since childhood and was terrified of throwing up, which would have made the situation even worse. The young man sighed and admitted that he’d had leftovers for dinner—garlic shrimp and frozen chive dumplings.  

The young woman shot him a sideways glance and quipped, “Oh, by the way, there’s a chive stuck in your teeth—on the right.”  

Speechless, the young man could only sigh in defeat.  

Xiao A tried to lighten the mood by thanking him for opening the sunroof. The young woman rolled her eyes slightly, but her expression softened.  

Through all this commotion, the driver remained undisturbed. He leaned back in his slightly reclined seat, face obscured by his cap, seemingly asleep.  

By now, it was 8:30 PM. If Xiao A’s destination was next, they had about 30 minutes to go.


## Chapter 2

Night had fallen, and the brightest stars were faintly visible in the clear, cloudless sky. Though the open sunroof let in considerable noise, no one brought up the idea of closing it anymore. Xiao A put on her headphones and resumed listening to her podcast. The girl wearing a mask leaned back into the corner and closed her eyes, resting. In the back seat, the man continued watching his gaming videos. Once again, the car returned to its usual quiet, detached atmosphere.  

The seemingly ordinary SUV sped along the highway at a constant speed, like every other vehicle, maintaining a safe, calculated distance. Few cars changed lanes, except near the highway exits and entrances.  

After an indeterminate amount of time, Xiao A suddenly felt uneasy—outside, it was too dark. Where were the roadside lights that should have been there? All that remained were reflective strips illuminated by the car’s headlights. Thankfully, there were other cars on the road, all maintaining a steady speed, as if nothing were wrong.  

But which road was this? They were no longer on the wide, five-lane highway from earlier. Whose destination was so remote? Would the car still get her to her destination on time? Xiao A began to feel suspicious. However, she hesitated to ask anyone else in the car, especially not wanting to wake the man in the driver's seat, who was sleeping with his face covered by a baseball cap.  

Xiao A glanced cautiously toward the backseat. The other two didn’t seem to have noticed anything unusual. Maybe it was fine after all.  

Some time later, Xiao A noticed the navigation system on the dashboard showed the vehicle was offline. This wasn't entirely unexpected; the system was designed to handle weak signals by downloading offline maps during route planning, allowing the vehicle to continue autonomous driving using traditional GPS even without a network connection.  

She checked her phone for a signal—it was also gone.  

“Huh? Why is there no signal? Where are we?” the man in the back seat said in surprise. Judging by the expression of the masked girl, she had no signal either. Everyone wore puzzled and annoyed looks, as losing connection in this era was almost akin to being blind.  

Xiao A adjusted the offline map on the dashboard and asked the two in the back, “Is either of your destinations nearby?”  

Both shook their heads. Everyone’s eyes turned toward the man in the driver’s seat, still asleep.  

“Should we wake him up and ask?” the girl in the back suggested.  

Summoning her courage, Xiao A reached over and nudged the man’s arm. “Excuse me, sir, wake up!”  

After a few nudges, the man stirred. He removed his baseball cap, revealing a furrowed brow. “Have we arrived?”  

“No. We seem to be in a very remote area. Look at the map—is this your destination?”  

“...No. This isn’t where I’m going. We’re too far north now. My destination is east, in T City.”  

“Let me see if I can manually reroute us back to T City. Since we’re offline, I might not be able to adjust it using my phone.” Xiao A focused intently on the dashboard settings.  

“Wait, who are you all? Are you trying to kidnap me?” the girl in the back seat suddenly blurted out, her tone filled with fear as she glanced at each of them in turn.  

“No one’s kidnapping you! Stop with the paranoia,” the man in the back said, exasperated.  

“Miss, it’s likely an issue with the central traffic control system. It might even have been hacked. By the way, I’m Xiao A, and I work in information security,” Xiao A said without looking back, her hands busy with the dashboard.  

“You’re in information security? Shouldn’t hacking into this system be a piece of cake for you?” the man in the back asked suspiciously.  

“Absolutely no. The central traffic control system took two years to develop and three years to test. Its security measures surpass even financial systems.”  

“I believe Xiao A,” the driver interjected calmly. “What reason would a young woman have to take three strangers to the middle of nowhere at night?” He added, “My name is Meng Yu.”  

The man in the back nodded. “Nice to meet you, I’m Wang Xia.” He glanced outside at the other cars moving steadily and remarked, “It’s clear this isn’t just our car having issues. Let’s hope the traffic control headquarters realizes so many vehicles have veered off course soon.”  

This comment sparked a realization in Xiao A: even if every car on this road had suddenly decided to head to some northern town, the central system should detect the anomaly in traffic demand and flag it. If no one had noticed, it could only mean the vehicles’ destinations and statuses had been altered in the monitoring algorithm. No, not deleted—deletion would trigger a high-level alert. Instead, someone must have overwritten the data with simulated normal driving information.  

Her thoughts raced, focused entirely on the technical challenge.  

“Do you think the other drivers have realized they’ve gone off course?” the masked girl asked, her voice still tinged with anxiety. “Can you see if anyone in the other cars is signaling or waving?”  

Everyone tried peering into the darkness, but it was too dim to make out anything.  

“Try using the hazard lights!” Wang Xia suggested excitedly.  

Meng Yu pressed the emergency light button, and the hazards began blinking. The three of them, except Xiao A, focused intently on the other cars, hoping for a response. But there was none. Their expressions grew heavier.  

“Why? Why would anyone want to kidnap so many people and vehicles at once? Have the others not noticed? Are they…dead?” The girl’s voice broke as panic set in.  

“This scale of deviation suggests a high-level insider at the central headquarters, likely a hacker or terrorist organization,” Xiao A said. “This isn’t a small matter. Ordinary hackers couldn’t achieve this from the outside. We need to bypass the traffic control system and report directly to the police.”  

The mention of the police caused Meng Yu’s expression to shift slightly. Though subtle, Xiao A caught the change. She made a mental note to stay cautious around him.  

Suddenly, the masked girl began to hyperventilate, leaning forward with tears in her eyes. Wang Xia hurriedly handed her a tissue, which she accepted with a grateful nod. She finally removed her mask, revealing her face. Wang Xia’s eyes widened in shock, but he said nothing. The girl, noticing his reaction, quickly put her mask back on and withdrew into her corner.  

Xiao A tried sending an emergency satellite message via her phone: *“Vehicle WS495N has severely deviated from its route. Please investigate.”* After a long wait, there was no response—likely due to a weak signal.  

“Maybe it’s not as bad as it seems,” Wang Xia stammered. “If enough people don’t arrive on time and can’t be contacted, their friends or family might call the police.”  

Xiao A closed her eyes, still deep in thought, trying to figure out how the hack could have been executed.  

Meng Yu suddenly pointed at the dashboard. “Look at this map. In five minutes, we’ll reach a seaside town. If we keep going, we’ll drive into the ocean within ten minutes.”  

It was already 9:23 p.m.


## Chapter 3
Time ticked by as Xiao A, Wang Xia, and the girl in the backseat frantically refreshed their phones, desperate to find a signal. They had entered the coastal town’s perimeter, where reception should have been restored. Yet, this proximity to the lake meant their fate loomed ever closer. Only Meng Yu seemed composed, his voice cutting through the tension as he addressed Wang Xia in the backseat.  

“Can you reach my bag in the trunk?”  

Wang Xia protested, “We should be calling the police right now!”  

Meng Yu countered coldly, “What’s the point? The cops won’t arrive in a minute, but they certainly can fish us out of the lake after we’ve drowned.”  

Wang Xia hesitated, then asked, “So what’s your plan?”  

“Smash the windows. The moment we hit the water, we swim out. There’s a tool in my bag. It’s a black one, behind your seat.”  

Xiao A shivered at Meng Yu’s preparedness. What kind of person carried tools designed to break car windows?  

Wang Xia scrambled to unbuckle his seatbelt and knelt on his seat, stretching toward the trunk. “I see it, but I can’t reach it!” he exclaimed.  

“Then slide to the middle seat and fold your seatback down,” Meng Yu instructed with chilling calm.  

“Wait a minute!” Xiao A said. “It doesn’t look like we’re heading into the sea.. Look ahead!”  

All eyes turned forward. The convoy of cars had slowed and was now queuing to board a ferry.  

The girl in the backseat stopped fiddling with her phone. Her trembling hands froze as an SOS signal appeared on her screen. She hastily dialed the police. The faint signal made the wait for the call to connect agonizing.  

“Hello, do you need assistance?”  The voice was quite chunky. 

“Our car has been diverted! We’re being driven onto a ferry!”  

“Are you in immediate danger?”  

“...Not yet. But this whole situation is bizarre! Please help us! There are dozens of cars being herded to this remote location!”  

“Ma’am, if this is not an immediate emergency, such traffic coordination issues should be reported to the transportation bureau. However, I’ll forward your case. May I have your vehicle number?”  

The girl glanced at Xiao A, who hurriedly handed her phone over so she could recite the license plate.  

“Hold on while I contact the transportation bureau.” Then, silence.  

At that moment, their car rolled into the ferry’s dark interior. Hundreds of vehicles slowly parked in the ship’s belly. One by one, engines turned off, and headlights extinguished. The ferry’s interior blocked all phone signals, leaving only the faint glow of screens to pierce the darkness.  

Wang Xia was about to resume his effort to retrieve the bag when Xiao A interrupted, “I think I saw people with flashlights up ahead!”  

Meng Yu snapped, “They can be of real danger. Wang Xia, stay put. Everyone, keep quiet and turn off your screens.”  

Xiao A’s heart pounded. She glanced at the driver of the car parked a meter away. The person sat motionless, seemingly asleep. She nudged Meng Yu with her gaze, silently urging him to notice. He nodded faintly, indicating he already had.  

The passengers in the other vehicles appeared to be unconscious—or pretending to be.  

Meng Yu squinted, assessing the situation. “There are about six or seven of them. Everyone, play dead.”  

Xiao A tilted her head, closed her eyes, and fell silent. The girl in the back leaned her head against the door, eyes shut. Wang Xia squeezed his eyes closed, his face betraying his struggle to conceal fear. Meng Yu pulled his cap lower over his face.  

Through a crack in her hair, Xiao A peeked at the approaching figures. She whispered, barely audible, “Most of them are gone. Two people with flashlights are walking from that end in this direction.”  

**9:30 PM.**  
All they could do was wait—and pray.

## Chapter 4
**An Hour Earlier**  

On the second deck of the ferry, a young man with curly hair sipped coffee as the sea breeze tousled his locks. A vibration from his satellite phone broke his reverie.  

L glanced at the message on the screen: **Program Initiated.**  
His eyes widened. The operation had started a full four hours ahead of schedule. Panic struck him as he checked his wristwatch and then the program’s settings. Could he have made a mistake? Did he set the wrong time zone? Cold sweat trickled down his back.  

Cursing his carelessness, L quickly radioed the ship’s captain, S. “Captain, the vehicles might arrive four hours early!”  

“Damn it!” S was in the first-deck lounge, lazily playing cards with his crew. They had jammed the town’s communication signals for this heist, leaving satellite phones as their only means of contact.  

“Maybe the transportation bureau got suspicious, and the mole changed the plan. You’d better get ready. I’ve got my hands full here. Inform the two operatives onboard; they might not know yet.”  

“Fine. The sooner we finish, the sooner we leave. Let’s get to work, boys,” S called out. Bored to death, the five crew members eagerly abandoned their game and sprang into action, preparing for the ferry’s docking and the stolen cars’ arrival.  

Meanwhile, L tried contacting the mole via a secure channel, anxiously awaiting a response. To distract himself, he checked his laptop’s logs and vehicle data records. Was it really his error, or was someone sabotaging the operation?  

L’s stomach churned when he discovered that the mole had revoked their access to the transportation bureau’s central system. Panic set in. Had the mole been compromised? Or had they deliberately gone rogue? And yet, the program had executed flawlessly. Why hadn’t he been warned?  

Desperate for answers, L combed through temporary backups of the program logs.  

Before diving deeper into his work, a nagging thought gnawed at him. Something critical was slipping through his grasp. Stepping onto the empty second-deck balcony for clarity, he scanned the surroundings. Where were the two operatives sent by the other organization?  

Feeling the situation spiraling out of control, L returned to his workstation. He decided to open the mysterious large box they had brought onboard.  

Just as he reached for the box, footsteps approached his door. He swallowed hard, turned back to his desk, and pretended to focus on the logs.  

Three sharp knocks broke the silence.  

“Come in. Door’s open,” L said gruffly, masking his unease.  

The door creaked open, revealing the two operatives, X and Z, from the other organization.  

“Hey, L,” X, a tall and wiry man, greeted him. “S said the program launched early. What’s going on?”  

L’s instincts screamed that X already knew the answer.  

“I don’t know,” L replied honestly. “Maybe the mole decided to act early. Or it could be an error.”  

“Can the vehicles still be controlled as planned once they arrive?” X asked, his tone even but probing.  

L’s mind raced. This was a pivotal question. Did they want the operation to succeed, or were they planning to betray him? His response could determine his fate.  

“I’m not sure,” L admitted cautiously. “We’ll have to test it when the cars arrive. Right now, I’m still figuring out what went wrong.”  

X nodded, his expression unreadable. “Got it. Sorry to bother you.” With that, he and Z left without further comment.  

L’s unease deepened. Something was brewing, and he was right in the eye of the storm.


## Chapter 5
**The Ship’s Cargo Hold**  

Time passed slowly. Small beams of flashlight occasionally swept across their faces, visible even through closed eyelids. Little A could feel the light touch her face shortly. Finally, the sound of footsteps faded. Moments later, the ship’s engines roared to life, vibrating the entire vessel. Little A glanced at her watch. It was only 9:40 PM. Barely ten minutes had passed.  

Wang Xia cautiously opened his eyes and whispered, "I think they’re gone." He scanned the surroundings but was met with nothing but darkness.  

Little A tried the car door, but it was still locked.  

Meng Yu immediately turned to Wang Xia. “Brother, keep going!”  

The girl in the back seat huddled tightly into a corner, trying to distance herself from Wang Xia, who was now kneeling between the front seats to retrieve something from the trunk. She looked at Little A and whispered, “Even if we get out of the car, what then? The ship’s already left the dock. We can’t go back to shore, and there are bad guys on board.”  

Little A replied, “There may be bad guys on the ship, but there must also be a satellite phone. Whatever their reason for kidnapping us, they’ll need to communicate with the outside world.”  

Meng Yu interrupted, “What if it’s not a kidnapping? The people in the other cars—we don’t even know if they’re alive.”  

Little A reasoned, “If they just wanted to kill us or stage a terrorist attack, why go to all this trouble? They clearly have the power to control so many vehicles. They could do anything with that.”  

Wang Xia chimed in, “Have you heard about the Sewol Ferry disaster years ago? There were rumors that the sinking was some sort of sacrificial offering.”  

At that moment, he pulled Meng Yu’s bag from the trunk. It was heavy. After resetting the seat, he handed it to Meng Yu.  

Little A peeked inside and saw flashlights and an array of metal tools. Meng Yu pulled out a chisel and a hammer, then donned a baseball cap and gloves. He looked at Little A and instructed, “Be careful of the glass shards. Use your clothes to cover yourself.”  

A few forceful hits later, the driver’s side window was riddled with cracks. With a final push, Meng Yu broke the glass into a single, clean sheet, then carefully cleared the remaining shards around the frame. He climbed out first, followed by Little A, whom he helped from the outside. Wang Xia glanced at the girl in the back seat and gestured for her to go next, but she shook her head. Wang Xia sighed and climbed out.  

Little A turned back and asked the girl, “Aren’t you coming out?”  

The girl responded, “What’s the point? I might be safer staying here.”  

Little A pressed, “We could find a lifeboat and row back. Or we could try to find a signal and call for help. People in the city must have noticed we’re missing by now.”  

The girl hesitated. “What if we run into those bad guys? Isn’t it riskier out there? Wouldn’t it be better to wait here for rescue?”  

Little A shook her head. “We know too little about the situation. We can’t just sit here and do nothing.” She then turned to Wang Xia and Meng Yu, who were inspecting a nearby car. “Try smashing a few other windows. Maybe the people inside are just unconscious.”  

Wang Xia and Meng Yu nodded and moved to the car behind theirs, where the spacing was slightly wider.  

Meanwhile, Little A continued coaxing the girl. “Sister, it’s not safe here. And Meng Yu… I don’t think we can trust him.”  

The girl immediately nodded in agreement. “I don’t trust Wang Xia either.”  

Catching her drift, Little A added, “Why don’t you come out, and we’ll stick together?”  

Finally, with Little A’s help, the girl climbed out. “I’m CC,” she said softly.  

Little A noticed how frail CC seemed—so thin, light, and cold to the touch.  

“CC? That name sounds familiar.”  

“You don’t know me?” CC’s eyes brightened for a moment. “That’s great.”  

Just then, Wang Xia and Meng Yu returned, reporting grimly, “The people inside are still breathing, but we can’t wake them. They seem to be deeply unconscious.”  

CC’s eyes widened in realization. “It’s an inhaled anesthetic or tranquilizer! It must be! We didn’t pass out because we opened the sunroof shortly after the car was sealed.”  

Little A nodded, a light bulb going off in her mind. “That makes sense. We have Wang Xia’s midday dumpling feast to thank for that.”  

Meng Yu frowned. “Dumplings? What are you talking about?”  

Wang Xia awkwardly explained the situation, prompting a chuckle from Little A despite the tension.  

CC continued, “If we break the windows on other cars, ventilating them might help the others wake up over time. If not, they could be in real danger.”  

Meng Yu pointed out, “But if we keep smashing windows here, we’ll eventually draw the bad guys’ attention.”  

Wang Xia suggested, “Then we need to get out of this level, find a signal, or locate a satellite phone or lifeboat.”  

Little A proposed, “We should split up. Two of us stay here—one to keep watch and the other to smash windows—while the other two go search for help. I’ll go with CC to look for a signal. You two can stay here.”  

Meng Yu hesitated. “It’s too dangerous for you two to go alone. If you run into the kidnappers, you won’t be able to defend yourselves. I’ll go instead.”  

CC immediately objected, “I won’t go with Wang Xia.”  

Meng Yu asked, “Why not?”  

“No reason.”  

Frustrated, Meng Yu said, “Now’s not the time to act petty, miss. We need to move fast.”  

Little A looked at CC sympathetically, sensing her reluctance.  

Wang Xia’s expression darkened with a mix of guilt and anger. Finally, he muttered, “Fine. I’m a scumbag. I admit it. I’m sorry.”  

CC’s face hardened as she turned away, struggling to maintain her composure.  

Meng Yu’s eyes narrowed. “What did you do to her?”  

Wang Xia stammered, unsure whether to explain.  

CC finally spoke. “Tell him.”  

Wang Xia sighed. “CC is a well-known underground idol. A voyeuristic video of her was leaked in a private Telegram group.”  

“That wasn’t even me!” CC shouted angrily.  

“We know,” Little A said firmly. “The video’s already been analyzed end to end on tech forums. It’s obviously deepfake.”  

Meng Yu exhaled in relief. “Then what’s the big deal? The video isn’t real. He didn’t make it or uploaded it. He’s apologized. Can’t we move on?”  

Little A shot back, “The issue is people like him are the reason this kind of stuff keeps happening. It’s not just videos—it’s live-streamed crimes, exploitation, and worse. Men like him never suffer the consequences while women who did nothing wrong have to live through hell.”  

Meng Yu fell silent, acknowledging her point.  

Wang Xia turned away, visibly ashamed. He muttered, “I’ll keep smashing the windows. Don’t worry about me. I can run faster without her. I can’t protect her anyway.”  

After some coaxing, Little A and CC hugged tightly. “It’s all passed. We need to focus on now and we will get through this,” Little A encouraged CC to put herself together.

As they left, Wang Xia lit a cigarette, muttering to himself “Fuck, when will us men stop being slaves to their sexual desires.” as he continued smashing windows.  

“Hey, could you put that out?” a weak voice suddenly croaked from the car window Wang Xia just smashed .

## Chapter 6
**9:25 PM**

L stood outside of his office located on the second-deck, gazing out the window at hundreds of cars smoothly driving onto the ship and parking in an orderly manner in the lower cargo hold. Once parked, two crew members began their inspection to ensure the cargo deck was properly sealed. Thankfully, this critical step went off without a hitch. L felt a slight sense of pride—at least the first half of their plan had gone smoothly. Yet, his unease lingered.  

It was this very unease that had prompted L, an hour earlier, to quietly move the contents from a large box in his room to a corner on the second deck after the tall, thin man named X had left. He covered the contents he took out of the box with a tarp already there on the deck, making it look inconspicuous. The wind on the deck was strong—judging from the fluttering flags, the wind speed was at least 35 km/h. After completing his preparations, L returned to his room and continued his attempts to connect to the traffic bureau’s systems. By analyzing several auxiliary databases and program logs, he deduced that at least three safety monitoring modules were malfunctioning. However, the modules for tracking vehicle routes and driving data were operational, which explained why no alarms had been triggered by the safety surveillance system. While he couldn’t get a full picture of the system’s status, things hadn’t yet spiraled out of control.  

As L stood on the deck lost in thought, a young man from the car theft group named Ben approached him. Ben, who was apparently related to S, had dropped out of high school recently. He asked L if he wanted to head down and check things out. L shook his head. “No need. You guys can handle it,” he replied. With that, Ben and the other members of the car theft group, along with two representatives of the anti-government faction, headed down to the cargo hold to inspect.  

Car theft—what an outdated crime. Eight years ago, it was rampant in developed countries. Stolen vehicles would be smuggled via shipping routes to the Middle East and Africa. But in recent years, after governments requisitioned and modified private vehicles for centralized dispatch, cars could no longer be driven by private individuals without authorization. As a result, car theft syndicates had largely disbanded.  

L chuckled at the irony of finding himself in league with such people. But as the saying goes, “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” To undermine public trust in the government’s vehicle control policies, was it really such a big deal to restore “freedom” to a few hundred cars? L reassured himself with this thought.  

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 over a decade ago, global economic downturns and widening wealth gaps had fueled numerous random vehicle-ramming attacks around the world. Busy intersections, school gates, and Christmas markets were frequent targets. From 2023 to 2026 alone, these incidents resulted in thousands of casualties in China and hundreds of deaths in Europe. Fear gripped the public. Governments tried everything—roadblocks, armed patrols, and other measures—but with so many vehicles and roads, they simply couldn’t cover every angle.  

Meanwhile, autonomous driving technology had reached maturity. Top tech companies seized the moment to lobby lawmakers and advocate for the abolition of private car ownership. Initially, there was significant pushback, especially from insurance companies, driver unions, and car enthusiasts. But the public’s growing frustration with traffic congestion, long commutes, high insurance costs, and dangerous roads eventually drowned out opposition, particularly in a digital space dominated by tech monopolies. Governments, in turn, offered compromises to car enthusiasts, such as dedicating more racetracks for recreational driving, turning driving into an activity akin to horseback riding—restricted to controlled environments.  

As pilot programs succeeded in small cities, residents reported significantly lower travel costs and increased safety, paving the way for broader adoption of the policy across developed nations. While some countries implemented these policies for cost and efficiency reasons, authoritarian regimes used them primarily as tools for population control and suppression. In democratic nations, strict background and psychological checks allowed a select few to retain driving privileges, but these instances grew increasingly rare.  In many countries, the expense and inconvenience of owning a car were purposely increased to discourage private vehicles while allowance was given to public owned carpool services. 

L and the hacker collective he belonged to had long opposed government control over vehicles. His reasoning? It was simple: L just loved driving. He loved the freedom it offered. He couldn’t bear the idea of sitting passively in a car, staring at the scenery while a predetermined route dictated his journey.  

L wasn’t particularly political. If he had to be labeled, he’d likely fall under “chaotic neutral” anarchism. Over the years, his group had targeted authoritarian regimes’ firewalls, hacked Swiss bank databases, disrupted Wall Street’s trading systems, and even waged cyber wars against terrorist organizations. Sometimes, they clashed with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies; other times, they were co-opted or manipulated by them. Occasionally, their actions stirred enough trouble to land them on international wanted lists.  

Most of L’s work didn’t require him to be physically present; it was typically done online. But resetting the systems of so many vehicles in the middle of international waters required him to set up a 5G local network. Now that the cars had arrived, it was time to get to work. L picked up his coffee, ready to return to his task.


## Chapter 7

Having left the ship’s lower deck, Meng Yu, Xiao A, and CC huddled together to plan their next move. 

The first priority was to alert the authorities. To do this, they needed to get their phones outdoors to search for a signal. If that failed, they would focus on self-rescue—finding lifeboats near the stern or the sides of the ship and rowing back if necessary. Their last resort was to risk entering the bridge to use the satellite phone, which all large ships are equipped with. Above all, they needed to avoid being spotted, and if caught, surrender immediately to prevent direct confrontation.

The three crept up to the deck near the bow, carefully observing their surroundings. The only sounds were the roaring wind and the ship's engine. A light shone from a room above, but the ocean around them was an endless expanse of darkness. Xiao A and CC quickly took out their phones, searching for a signal, but there was none. It was already 10 p.m., and though it was summer, the wind from the moving ship chilled them to the bone. The two huddled together for warmth.

Meanwhile, Meng Yu remained vigilant, gauging their distance from the shore. The lighthouse seemed about 20 kilometers away—too far to swim. He tried recalling the islands and routes in this area. There might be one or two desolate islands nearby, but his familiarity with these waters was limited.

"No signal. I can't even send an SOS," Xiao A said, frustrated. "Let’s look for the lifeboats."

Meng Yu nodded. "Alright, we'll find the lifeboats, then get Wang Xia and leave."

Xiao A hesitated. "Meng Yu, do you know where the lifeboats are and what they look like?" Her initial distrust of Meng Yu was fading; she was even beginning to see him as an ally.

Meng Yu replied, "There are usually two types. One hangs off the stern—it’s a rescue boat. You just untie the ropes, and it drops straight into the sea. The other is a white capsule-like raft near the sides of the ship. It inflates automatically when released, and we can climb in using the ladder."

CC, visibly more at ease, asked, "Uncle, were you a sailor before?"

Meng Yu coughed. "Yeah, I was a sailor for ten years." But inside, he winced. *Uncle? Do I look that old?* The young woman’s words made him feel a sudden pang of age.

As they whispered, they moved quietly along the inner side of the deck. Reaching a cross corridor midship, they froze. From behind a wall, they heard the sound of a toilet flushing. Meng Yu gestured for Xiao A and CC to stop and hide under a nearby bench. He listened carefully as water ran from the sink. Someone was about to emerge. Meng Yu quickly calculated: one person was manageable; two could be risky. If there were more, direct confrontation would be unwise. He gripped his makeshift weapon—a long spike—and prepared to ambush.

The restroom door opened, casting a shadow on the floor and the opposite wall. *Good, just one person,* Meng Yu thought, his confidence growing. Within two seconds, he seized the unsuspecting crew member, locking his throat and pinning him to the ground. The spike rested against the man’s side, a silent warning.

The girls heard the sudden end of the whistling tune the man had been humming, followed by faint scuffling sounds. Then, Meng Yu’s soft signal for safety. They crept over and helped drag the subdued crew member into the women’s restroom. Once inside, they turned on the light. The man was young, with a face that didn’t look particularly menacing. This made Meng Yu feel a twinge of guilt, but the dire situation and the dozens of people trapped below hardened his resolve.

“Don’t call for help. Cooperate, and you won’t get hurt. Understand?” Meng Yu said sternly. The crew member nodded fearfully. 

CC and Xiao A were visibly shaken. CC turned away, unable to face the scene, while Xiao A busied herself stuffing tissues into the door’s gaps to block any light.

“Who are you people? Why are you holding all these cars and passengers hostage?” Meng Yu demanded.

The man, terrified, shook his head but didn’t speak.

“Answer me! Quietly,” Meng Yu pressed.

“We’re just car thieves!” the man stammered. “The cars weren’t supposed to have anyone in them. Did you stow away with the cars?”

“Don’t lie. Many of the cars had people inside, all unconscious. You clearly tampered with them.”

“I don’t know anything about that! There’s a hacker onboard, someone called L. He’s the one who arranged for these cars. We’re just hired to transport and sell them. I swear I didn’t know there were people in them. L is in the lit room on the second floor at the bow. I can take you there.”

“And how do I know you’re not leading us into a trap?”

“Look, I’m just a grunt working under my uncle, doing manual labor. We’re talking about stealing cars—big deal, maybe a couple of years in prison. But kidnapping and trafficking people? That’s 15 years or more. I’d never get involved in something like that. Let the girls sneak over and check the room. If it’s just L in there, you’ll know I’m not lying.”

Meng Yu glanced at Xiao A and CC, uncertain whether to trust them with such a risky task. CC hesitated too, torn between fear and the desire to stay with Meng Yu, whose competence she now relied on. Finally, Xiao A said, “I’ll go alone. Two people are easier to spot. I’ll just take a quick look and be back in three minutes.”

CC wanted to protest but couldn’t find the words. Instead, she hugged Xiao A tightly, ashamed of her own fear. Xiao A patted her back, reassuring her. “I’ll be fine,” she said softly.

“I’ll walk you out,” CC said. “I don’t want you getting ambushed like this guy.” Xiao A nodded.

Heart pounding, Xiao A slipped out of CC’s sight, not knowing what fate awaited her.


## Chapter 8

In the restroom, Meng Yu continued interrogating the crew member, who introduced himself as Ben.

“How many of you are on this ship? Are they all part of your car theft ring?” Meng Yu asked.

“There are eight of us in the crew. Our boss, S, is in charge. There’s also a hacker and two people who seem to be with some kind of anti-government group,” Ben replied nervously.

“What does this anti-government group have to do with your operation?”

“I’m not sure. Maybe they’re just working together to split the profits.”

“That doesn’t add up,” CC interrupted angrily. “Someone had to modify those vehicles, bribing inspectors to install timed sedatives. This isn’t a coincidence. That’s why all the people below deck are unconscious.”

Ben shook his head emphatically. “I swear I’ve never heard about that. We just wanted the cars. Bringing people along only complicates things.”

Meng Yu mulled over the information for a moment. “Then it’s clear. The anti-government group must be planning a mass kidnapping. You only care about the cars, so they’re using your ship and the hacker’s expertise. No—wait. That hacker, L, might be working for them too.”

Ben hesitated. “I don’t think so. Earlier today, the hacker was the one who warned us the cars were arriving ahead of schedule. He looked genuinely panicked, not like he was acting.”

“So the most dangerous people on this ship are those two,” Meng Yu concluded. “But even your car theft gang wouldn’t hesitate to kill us and toss us overboard if they see us as a threat, right?”

Ben nodded reluctantly. CC, growing increasingly anxious, glanced toward the door. She couldn’t stop thinking about Xiao A. *Come back already. It’s been two minutes, but it feels like forever.*

“What was your original plan for the cars?” Meng Yu asked.

“We were supposed to dock at a nearby island, unload the cars, and over the next two days, move them in batches to ships waiting in international waters. Once the cars were on those ships, our job would be done.”

“Eight of you unloading that many vehicles?” Meng Yu probed further.

“There are two other groups waiting for us on the island. But most of the unloading is automated. The hacker remotely drives the cars off, just like how he got them on board. If you look closely, you’ll see the cars are parked by model and age. That way, they’ll be arranged the same way on the island.”

CC sneered. “Impressive logistics for a gang of criminals.”

Ben gave a sheepish smile. 

“Where are your people now?” Meng Yu’s tone remained as sharp as ever. There was no room for levity or relaxation.

“Three of them are usually in the control room, steering the ship. The rest should be in the crew quarters on the first floor, drinking and playing cards.”

“And those two men from the anti-government group? What are their names, and where do they usually stay?”

“There’s a tall, skinny guy named X—quiet and intense. The other is stockier; his name is Z. I’m pretty sure they’re armed, but honestly, everyone in this line of work carries weapons. Sometimes they drink with us, but most of the time, they keep to themselves. The ship’s big, and they don’t do much work, so I don’t see them often.”

“Where are the satellite phones on the ship?”

“There’s one in the captain’s quarters, one with the hacker, and probably one with those two guys.”

“You don’t have a gun on you?” Meng Yu asked, scrutinizing him.

Ben shook his head. “No, I’m just here because my uncle brought me along to do grunt work. I don’t get a weapon. Look, if we all end up getting caught by the cops, can you put in a good word for me? I’ll never do this again, I swear.”

Meng Yu nodded slightly. “Fine. But for now, I’ll have to tie you up and gag you. Understand?”

Ben grimaced but didn’t resist. “Yeah, I get it.”

Using Ben’s own clothes, Meng Yu twisted and tied them into makeshift ropes, binding Ben’s hands and feet securely. He stuffed the man’s T-shirt into his mouth to gag him.

CC turned to Meng Yu, her voice hesitant. “What now? Should we look for a satellite phone or head for the lifeboats?”

Meng Yu replied firmly, “We wait for Xiao A. If the hacker is alone in that room, we’ll all go together to subdue him and use the satellite phone to call for help. If there’s more than one person, we head straight for the lifeboats.”

Suddenly, CC gasped. “We have to tell Wang Xia!”

Meng Yu smacked his forehead. “Right. I almost forgot about him. You stay here and watch Ben. I’ll go find him.”

CC hesitated but nodded reluctantly. “Okay. At least I can help pass on messages. That’s better than being completely useless.” 

As Meng Yu prepared to leave, CC felt the weight of the situation pressing down on her. Waiting in the restroom with a gagged hostage felt like an eternity. Meanwhile, Meng Yu slipped into the shadows, determined to find Wang Xia before it was too late.

## Chapter 9

10:10 PM. Xiao A cautiously approached the lit room on the second floor. It had a large window, likely providing a clear view of the surroundings. She quietly peeked inside—and froze.  

A terrifyingly familiar profile. The same Technica headphones perched on his head. His eyes were fixed intently on the screen. Even with just half his face visible, Xiao A immediately pictured his whole posture—the slight hunch of his back, one leg crossed casually over the other, and those long, slender fingers at work.  

Her caution evaporated in an instant. She stormed to the door and pushed. It was locked. Gritting her teeth to suppress her anger, she marched up to the window and stood there, unmoving. When she saw his full face, the small differences didn’t matter. It was him.  

Inside, L didn’t notice her at first. But then, out of the corner of his eye, he caught a figure standing by the window. Startled, he looked up—and froze.  

Why was A here? For two seconds, he just stared at her, dumbfounded. Xiao A raised her hand and pointed to the door.  

Still unsure if he was dreaming, L hesitated but eventually walked over to unlock the door.  

The moment Xiao A stepped inside, she punched him squarely in the face.  

The pain jolted L back to reality. Clutching his cheek, he quickly grabbed her wrist to prevent another hit. Keeping his voice low, he said, “Alright, alright! I get it—I messed up. Just keep it down, or someone will hear us! How did you even find me here?”  

“Impressive,” Xiao A said icily. “Big-shot hacker now, huh? I thought you were just some guy who wrote buggy code. And now you’re stealing cars and kidnapping people?”  

“What? Kidnapping? What are you talking about?” L’s denial was automatic, but the nagging doubt that had been gnawing at him all day suddenly crystallized.  

“How do you think I ended up on this ship? Flew here?”  

The truth hit L like a freight train. *Shit. There were people in those cars.* His legs gave out, and he collapsed into his chair.  

He finally understood what had gone wrong. The module their mole had skipped wasn’t just for security and hardware checks—it also skipped the final completion check. If the operation had gone as planned at midnight, with those checks included, no passengers would have been left in the cars. He had been careless, never imagining the thieves would bring passengers along. But why?  

Clutching his aching face, his mind raced through possibilities.  

Xiao A’s voice snapped him back. “Start the cars. Open every window. Everyone inside is unconscious.”  

“What? Unconscious?” L’s heart sank as he realized what X and Z’s group was planning. This wasn’t just theft. This was something much bigger.  

“Hurry up! Stop wasting time.”  

“I’m not done yet,” L muttered. “The 6G local network setup is almost ready, but the integration tests with the cars still need time. Just opening the windows might work. Give me half an hour.”  

“Then give me the satellite phone. I’ll call the police myself.” Xiao A extended her hand.  

L hesitated but eventually walked to the desk to retrieve the satellite phone.  

Before either of them could act further, two men appeared in the doorway, guns drawn.  

“Don’t move. Hand over the phone.”  

L turned to see X and Z, their weapons trained on him and Xiao A. L’s heart sank as he handed the phone to the tall, thin man, X, who slid it into his coat pocket.  

Sweat beaded on L’s forehead. This was the worst-case scenario. The group wasn’t just anti-government—it was a full-blown terrorist organization. Once they docked, reinforcements from both the terrorist and car theft groups would be waiting for them on the island. The thieves might not have planned to kidnap passengers, but they’d clearly been roped into the terrorists’ scheme.  

For now, L thought he might be safe. But Xiao A was in real danger. He glanced at her, trying to gauge how much she understood about their situation. Her expression was unreadable—no fear, no anger. L knew that look all too well. When Xiao A was truly furious, she didn’t show it.  

X, noticing the tension, smirked coldly. “And who’s this young lady? When did she get on board?”  

Xiao A didn’t respond. She wouldn’t waste words on someone playing games.  

X turned his attention to L. “You two seem to know each other. Sorry to interrupt your reunion. What’s your relationship? Care to share?”  

X’s tone was casual, but his gaze was sharp. The way his gun stayed pointed at Xiao A made it clear he’d already figured out she was important to L.  

L spoke carefully. “We went to college together. She was the top student in our class.”  

X’s eyes gleamed with understanding. Of course, these two weren’t just classmates. And L’s subtle message wasn’t lost on him either—this girl had value. His smile widened, colder and crueler.  

“You’ve got work to do, so I’ll take your old classmate for a tour of the ship. Didn’t you say you needed half an hour? Fine. You’ve got thirty minutes. Open the car doors by then.”  

With that, X rested a hand on Xiao A’s shoulder, guiding her out at gunpoint.  

L was left alone in the room, staring at his incomplete work, the unraveling plan, and the danger now looming over his old friend.  

He gripped his hair tightly, muttering to himself. “Stay calm. Stay calm. There’s always a way. She’ll be fine. She has to be.”

## Chapter 10

The three companions hadn’t been gone for long when Wang Xia discovered an awake passenger.  

This passenger, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer and required an oxygen tank, hadn’t completely lost consciousness. The sound of Wang Xia breaking the glass had startled her awake, and a few shards of glass had landed on her. She opened her eyes to see Wang Xia smoking a cigarette and quickly tried to move her oxygen tank away. She said, “Could you put out your cigarette?” This slightly older woman was named H.  

Wang Xia was overjoyed and wanted to rescue her immediately, but she waved her hand, saying she needed a moment to rest before she could move—her body felt too heavy. At her age, climbing out wasn’t so easy. Wang Xia, speaking through the now glassless car window, explained how the others had avoided the sedatives, escaped the vehicle, and were now searching for a lifeboat and calling for help. Soon, they’d be able to escape the ship.  

After chatting quietly with H for a moment, Wang Xia quickly moved on to smashing other car windows. He was in high spirits, thrilled to have saved someone. Who knew how many others might be trapped but conscious in their vehicles?  

But in his excitement, he didn’t notice the danger creeping closer. Z was making his way directly from L’s office to the lower deck. At the same time, Meng Yu had also reached this level and saw Wang Xia focused on breaking windows. However, near the bow of the ship, another figure had arrived, aiming a gun.  

“Get down!” Meng Yu’s shout echoed from nearby. But almost simultaneously, a gunshot rang out.  

Wang Xia didn’t understand what was happening. He just felt his body freeze, a coldness spreading through him, and then the impact as he hit the ground. His vision blurred. He realized he’d been shot somewhere in his chest. He felt blood pooling and his consciousness fading.  

Meng Yu’s warning had revealed his approximate location. Keeping low, he moved quickly between the cars, eventually sliding under one to hide. Z didn’t shoot again but instead approached Meng Yu’s position with deliberate, gun-ready steps. The ship’s engine roared loudly, masking the sound of his footsteps.  

The gunman walked past Wang Xia, who lay on the ground with open eyes, paying him no attention. He also overlooked H, who was pretending to be unconscious in her car. H was filled with shock, fear, and sorrow for the young man who had fallen trying to save others. Was he still alive? Where had he been shot? She couldn’t climb out of the car to check or save him.  

Meanwhile, CC, trembling in a restroom on the first floor, had also heard the gunshot from below. Her whole body shook. Was someone hurt or dead? Was it Meng Yu? Wang Xia? Or little A? CC shut her eyes tightly. When she opened them again, she saw the bound sailor and the first aid kit by the sink. Maybe there was still hope.  

But the enemy had a gun. If she went out, wouldn’t she just be throwing her life away? Yet her intuition told her someone needed urgent help. After a night of hesitation, she finally acted on impulse. She grabbed a tourniquet and scissors, then stepped out of the restroom, closing the door behind her. She retraced her steps quietly.  

Meng Yu, hiding under a car, watched Z’s boots getting closer and closer. Each step increased Meng Yu’s odds of success. Just stay calm. Wait. Fear was useless. Facing fear was the only way to conquer it. Truth be told, he wasn’t young anymore, and the intense situation had his heart racing. He used his experience to force himself to calm down.  

Halfway down the stairs, CC spotted the gunman moving slowly. Terrified, she silently took a few steps back. Clutching gauze and scissors, her whole body trembled. She told herself, “I’ve already been brave. Anything more would just be reckless.” Tears streamed down her face as she crouched against a wall in a dark corner, waiting helplessly for things to unfold.  

Z was now just a meter away from Meng Yu’s car. The air seemed to freeze. Meng Yu thought, *Firearms aren’t suited for close combat, and the lighting here is poor. If he steps one more foot closer, I can take him down.* As long as his position wasn’t discovered, there was hope.  

Z hesitated, unsure whether to move forward. He felt that someone was very close. He crouched down, trying to see under the car and maintain his balance. Meng Yu saw the man’s caution and realized he was an expert. If this continued, Meng Yu would be discovered. He had no choice but to take a gamble.  

He aimed at the man’s lower leg and threw his sharp, concealed dagger with all his strength. As the dagger hit its mark, another gunshot rang out.  

Hours earlier, these four didn’t know which other. Then they had been drawn into a shared nightmare. Wang Xia was shot and near death, Meng Yu’s life hung by a thread, Xiao A had been kidnapped, and only CC was temporarily safe.  

Hearing the second gunshot, CC turned back to the women’s restroom. She untied the sailor and pleaded with him to help her launch a lifeboat.  

“Is this all I can do? Am I just going to save myself?” she wondered. “Maybe. After all, I’m just a coward. These people are just strangers I met by chance. Why risk my life for them?”  

She tried to convince herself, remembering how they had planned to use the lifeboat to escape and call for help. How had things spiraled so far? *It’s not my fault,* she thought repeatedly.  

But she couldn’t forget how her companions had repeatedly taken risks for her, always finding excuses to protect her.  

Ben, meanwhile, also heard the gunshots below. He wanted to escape with CC but couldn’t abandon his uncle in the control room. Agreeing to CC’s request, he headed to the deck to prepare the lifeboat, letting the beautiful woman escape first while he went to find his uncle.  

At the same time, the car thieves playing cards in the lounge also heard the commotion from the lower deck. They exchanged glances and prepared to retrieve their guns from their rooms to investigate. Two of them grabbed radios to inform the captain.  

The control room was far from the lower deck, and S and his two assistants had no idea what was happening on the ship. But this ignorance wouldn’t last much longer. Soon, they’d find out.

## Chapter 11

X escorted Xiao A from L’s office toward the control room, his gun trained steadily on her. “How many of you escaped?” he asked coldly.  

Xiao A maintained a blank expression. “If you kill me, you’ll lose your leverage over L.”  

X smirked, conceding to the truth of her words. He nodded and said, “You’re right, young lady. I don’t usually make it a habit to torment women, but my patience has its limits.”  

With that, he grabbed Xiao A’s arm and twisted it hard behind her back.Xiao  A sickening crack echoed as her elbow joint shifted unnaturally, sending a searing pain up her arm. Xiao A screamed in agony, and X twisted further, a sharp reminder to cooperate.  

Unable to strategize through the pain, Xiao A finally blurted out, “Four! Four of us escaped!”  

X’s cold smile deepened as he saw the fear, regret, and anger flash across her face.  

He wasted no time. Using his satellite phone, X called headquarters to report the situation. “The disturbance on the ship is caused by four conscious hostages who managed to escape. My men are working to capture them. I’ll also know in half an hour whether the car theft organization will cooperate. If the vehicles remain locked, we may have to use the entire ship as leverage. The island operatives will need to handle the car thieves, but that introduces too many variables. L must open the vehicle doors as planned so the thieves can take the cars, while we concentrate the hostages in one location for negotiations with the government.”  

X didn’t care how much Xiao A overheard; to him, she was insignificant.  

However, A absorbed every detail. She began calculating survival probabilities for different scenarios. If all the captors wanted were hostages, maybe the best course was to stop resisting and wait for the negotiations to play out over the coming weeks. As much as she hated the man beside her, her rational mind told her that struggle might be futile.  

X pushed Xiao A toward the control room door and knocked. When the door opened, he shoved her inside.  

S, the ship’s captain, looked up in shock at the unexpected intruder and the young woman held at gunpoint. “What’s the meaning of this?” he demanded.  

“Hand over the satellite phone,” X ordered.  

S hesitated but had no choice. He complied.  

Now in control of L, the captain, the satellite phone, and the control room, X felt unstoppable. He addressed S in a calm but firm tone. “Don’t misunderstand. We haven’t reached the point of turning on each other yet. According to the plan, once we reach our destination, you take the cars, and we take the people—no interference. But circumstances have changed, and we need to ensure there are no misunderstandings. Cooperate and hand over the phone. For now, you, the girl, and your men will stay here for thirty minutes until my team resolves this situation.”  

At that moment, the captain’s radio crackled to life. A crew member reported the sound of gunfire from the lower deck and asked if they should investigate. Additionally, S’s nephew was missing. Hearing this, S felt a chill in his heart.  

X shot S a warning look, and the captain gritted his teeth before replying, “No one moves without orders. Stay safe.”  

---

Meanwhile, on the deck, CC and Ben struggled to release the capsule lifeboat. Ben, trained in maritime procedures, worked methodically, but he discovered something alarming—a steel cable had been discreetly added to secure the lifeboat, making it nearly impossible to deploy.  

CC saw the panic in Ben’s expression and understood that their opponents had sabotaged the lifeboat. Ben clenched his fists, realizing just how ruthless and unscrupulous their enemies were.  

Without hesitation, CC turned and ran back toward the lower deck. It felt like fate—there was no room left for cowardice.  

---

In the lower deck, a desperate fight unfolded.  

Z and Meng Yu were locked in hand-to-hand combat, their weapons—gun and knife—discarded nearby. Meng Yu initially gained the upper hand through technique, but Z’s superior strength and stamina began to shift the balance.  

Z managed to grab the knife and drove it into Meng Yu’s left shoulder. Meng Yu cried out in pain, and Z struck again, stabbing him in the side. Despite his injuries, Meng Yu stubbornly clung to Z’s throat, though his strength was fading rapidly.  

The situation grew dire. Just as Meng Yu was on the verge of collapse, a gunshot thundered nearby. Z’s hand, still clutching the knife, fell limp from Meng Yu’s shoulder.  

It was CC. She had picked up Z’s discarded gun and fired at point-blank range. She stared in disbelief at Z’s lifeless body, unable to process what she had just done.  

There was no time for reflection. She quickly retrieved gauze from her pocket and handed it to Meng Yu before remembering Wang Xia. Racing back to grab the first aid kit, she prayed it wasn’t too late.  

On her return, she saw Ben, disheveled and weary. She urged him to help Meng Yu stop the bleeding while she attended to Wang Xia.  

Ben, still bitter about the way the older man had treated him, hesitated. But seeing the extremes Z and X were willing to go, he understood the true threat. For a seaman, sabotaging lifeboats was an unforgivable crime. Gritting his teeth, he went to patch up Meng Yu’s wounds.  

Meng Yu’s injuries, though severe, weren’t fatal thanks to his muscle mass. Exhausted, he leaned against a car as Ben worked on him.  

Meanwhile, CC rushed to Wang Xia’s side. He was unconscious, with no noticeable breathing. She leaned down and faintly detected a weak heartbeat. The gunshot had hit near his right chest, close to his shoulder, and blood pooled beneath him.  

Frantically, she pressed gauze against the wound. Struggling to recall the steps for emergency aid, she felt overwhelmed until a soft voice broke through her panic.  

“Miss, there’s an oxygen tank here. Use it for him.”  

CC turned to see H, still conscious in her shattered vehicle. Overwhelmed with gratitude, CC took the oxygen tank and positioned the mask over Wang Xia’s face.  

Ben, finishing with Meng Yu, joined CC to reapply proper bandages. Meanwhile, CC assisted Wang Xia with oxygen and checked his pulse periodically, feeling it weaken with each passing moment.  

Desperation mounting, CC began performing CPR. As she pressed down on his chest, her voice shook with emotion.  

“Wang Xia, I know you’re a pervert,” she said, gasping between compressions. “But today… you were brave. You were good. I forgive you. But now— I need you— to be brave— for me— one more time. Just this once—this last time.”  

Tears fell onto Wang Xia’s closed eyes as she fought to bring him back.
