2:00 PM, at the docks. Two sailors were unloading cargo from a truck.  

“What the hell is in this box? It’s so heavy.”  

“Some kind of specialized electronic equipment, I heard. Expensive stuff, so be careful.”  

“By the way, is that guy really so capable? My uncle said he didn’t do a thing but already demanded three million upfront and another two million as a final payment. Don’t you think our boss is getting scammed?”  

“Shh, keep it down. He’s right up there watching. The guy’s making money off his skills. He is a smart weirdo.”  

On the second floor, a curly-haired young man in his twenties leaned against the railing, smiling mischievously.

### Chapter 1  

8:00 PM, dusk. A black SUV arrived punctually.  

Small suitcase in hand, Xiao A stood by the roadside outside her home, waiting for the vehicle to come to a complete stop. Inside the suitcase were essentials for a weekend trip to her friend’s place in T City, 100 kilometers away. After confirming the vehicle’s arrival on her phone, she loaded the suitcase into the trunk and approached the rear passenger door.  

The window was rolled down, and Xiao A noticed two passengers already in the back—a man and a woman seated far apart, seemingly strangers. The young woman in the back right seat wore a mask. Seeing this, Xiao A decided to try the front passenger seat instead. It was unoccupied. She opened the door, got in, and fastened her seatbelt.  

The man in the driver’s seat wore a low-brimmed cap and was staring intently at his phone. Once Xiao A was settled, the car pulled away from the residential area. The cabin remained eerily silent.  

All trips were optimized by the system. Even though the passengers didn’t know each other or each other’s destinations, the vehicle’s programming would drop everyone off at their designated locations in sequence. As the SUV moved through the city, wind gusted in through the rear window. The car wasn’t going fast, so it wasn’t unbearable, but Xiao A felt tempted to ask the woman in the back seat if she could roll the window up a bit. However, the oppressive quiet in the car discouraged her. The silence made her hesitant to speak, as if her voice might shatter it. She decided to endure it until they hit the highway.  

Once the car merged onto the intercity expressway and reached a speed of 80 kilometers per hour, the windows automatically rolled up, and the cabin’s air purifier and ventilation system kicked in. The smooth acceleration and braking of the autonomous vehicle provided a sense of security, eliminating concerns about fatigued driving. Xiao A put on her headphones and an eye mask, planning to listen to her favorite podcast during the one-to-two-hour journey. The latest episode of *SwitchOn* was about covert cameras and recording devices, and how the booming deepfake industry had spawned an intricate web of black-market activity.  

The other three passengers were equally silent, absorbed in their respective smart devices. In this age of heightened surveillance concerns, where micro-cameras and listening devices were prevalent, trust among strangers was fragile. Nobody could be sure if the person sitting next to them was a voyeur or if a chance encounter was a meticulously planned scam.  

Without warning, a long, resounding fart broke the silence in the back seat.  

The air soon filled with an unmistakable stench—a pungent mix of garlic and chives.  

The young woman in the back couldn’t hold back and muttered under her breath, “This is unbearable,” pinching the top edge of her mask and shifting closer to the door as if trying to merge with it. She attempted to open the window, but it was locked, requiring a system request to unlock.  

The young man, clearly embarrassed, bristled at her reaction but said nothing. Xiao A, who was equally overwhelmed by the smell, stretched out her hand to increase the ventilation fan speed, only to find that the system was stuck in recirculation mode.  

Feeling nauseous and desperate, Xiao A glanced upward and noticed the manual handle for the sunroof. Weakly, she pointed at it.  

Irritated, the young man snapped, “Seriously? Is it that big of a deal? Stop being so dramatic.”  

His words shattered the uneasy silence like a stone through glass.  

The young woman in the back snapped back, “Oh, shut up! Your breath already reeks of garlic. I smelled it the moment I got in. Do you want it to stink even more?”  

She unbuckled her seatbelt, stood up, and reached for the sunroof handle. However, her long acrylic nails hindered her efforts, and she couldn’t get it open.  

Seeing her struggle, Xiao A unbuckled her seatbelt despite the alarm beeping incessantly. She held her breath and reached out to help.  

The young man, visibly annoyed but also somewhat resigned, grumbled, “Fine, I’ll do it!” He unbuckled his seatbelt, stood up, and yanked the sunroof open.  

The car was instantly filled with the rush of wind, the chime of seatbelt alarms, and the laughter of two young women gasping for fresh air.  

The man muttered complaints under his breath as Xiao A and the young woman exchanged relieved glances, laughing uncontrollably.  

The ice broken, conversation flowed more easily. Xiao A explained how she’d been sensitive to the smell of chives since childhood and was terrified of throwing up, which would have made the situation even worse. The young man sighed and admitted that he’d had leftovers for dinner—garlic shrimp and frozen chive dumplings.  

The young woman shot him a sideways glance and quipped, “Oh, by the way, there’s a chive stuck in your teeth—on the right.”  

Speechless, the young man could only sigh in defeat.  

Xiao A tried to lighten the mood by thanking him for opening the sunroof. The young woman rolled her eyes slightly, but her expression softened.  

Through all this commotion, the driver remained undisturbed. He leaned back in his slightly reclined seat, face obscured by his cap, seemingly asleep.  

By now, it was 8:30 PM. If Xiao A’s destination was next, they had about 30 minutes to go.


**Chapter 2**  

Night had fallen, and the brightest stars were faintly visible in the clear, cloudless sky. Though the open sunroof let in considerable noise, no one brought up the idea of closing it anymore. Xiao A put on her headphones and resumed listening to her podcast. The girl wearing a mask leaned back into the corner and closed her eyes, resting. In the back seat, the man continued watching his gaming videos. Once again, the car returned to its usual quiet, detached atmosphere.  

The seemingly ordinary SUV sped along the highway at a constant speed, like every other vehicle, maintaining a safe, calculated distance. Few cars changed lanes, except near the highway exits and entrances.  

After an indeterminate amount of time, Xiao A suddenly felt uneasy—outside, it was too dark. Where were the roadside lights that should have been there? All that remained were reflective strips illuminated by the car’s headlights. Thankfully, there were other cars on the road, all maintaining a steady speed, as if nothing were wrong.  

But which road was this? They were no longer on the wide, five-lane highway from earlier. Whose destination was so remote? Would the car still get her to her destination on time? Xiao A began to feel suspicious. However, she hesitated to ask anyone else in the car, especially not wanting to wake the man in the driver's seat, who was sleeping with his face covered by a baseball cap.  

Xiao A glanced cautiously toward the backseat. The other two didn’t seem to have noticed anything unusual. Maybe it was fine after all.  

Some time later, Xiao A noticed the navigation system on the dashboard showed the vehicle was offline. This wasn't entirely unexpected; the system was designed to handle weak signals by downloading offline maps during route planning, allowing the vehicle to continue autonomous driving using traditional GPS even without a network connection.  

She checked her phone for a signal—it was also gone.  

“Huh? Why is there no signal? Where are we?” the man in the back seat said in surprise. Judging by the expression of the masked girl, she had no signal either. Everyone wore puzzled and annoyed looks, as losing connection in this era was almost akin to being blind.  

Xiao A adjusted the offline map on the dashboard and asked the two in the back, “Is either of your destinations nearby?”  

Both shook their heads. Everyone’s eyes turned toward the man in the driver’s seat, still asleep.  

“Should we wake him up and ask?” the girl in the back suggested.  

Summoning her courage, Xiao A reached over and nudged the man’s arm. “Excuse me, sir, wake up!”  

After a few nudges, the man stirred. He removed his baseball cap, revealing a furrowed brow. “Have we arrived?”  

“No. We seem to be in a very remote area. Look at the map—is this your destination?”  

“...No. This isn’t where I’m going. We’re too far north now. My destination is east, in T City.”  

“Let me see if I can manually reroute us back to T City. Since we’re offline, I might not be able to adjust it using my phone.” Xiao A focused intently on the dashboard settings.  

“Wait, who are you all? Are you trying to kidnap me?” the girl in the back seat suddenly blurted out, her tone filled with fear as she glanced at each of them in turn.  

“No one’s kidnapping you! Stop with the paranoia,” the man in the back said, exasperated.  

“Miss, it’s likely an issue with the central traffic control system. It might even have been hacked. By the way, I’m Xiao A, and I work in information security,” Xiao A said without looking back, her hands busy with the dashboard.  

“You’re in information security? Shouldn’t hacking into this system be a piece of cake for you?” the man in the back asked suspiciously.  

“Absolutely no. The central traffic control system took two years to develop and three years to test. Its security measures surpass even financial systems.”  

“I believe Xiao A,” the driver interjected calmly. “What reason would a young woman have to take three strangers to the middle of nowhere at night?” He added, “My name is Meng Yu.”  

The man in the back nodded. “Nice to meet you, I’m Wang Xia.” He glanced outside at the other cars moving steadily and remarked, “It’s clear this isn’t just our car having issues. Let’s hope the traffic control headquarters realizes so many vehicles have veered off course soon.”  

This comment sparked a realization in Xiao A: even if every car on this road had suddenly decided to head to some northern town, the central system should detect the anomaly in traffic demand and flag it. If no one had noticed, it could only mean the vehicles’ destinations and statuses had been altered in the monitoring algorithm. No, not deleted—deletion would trigger a high-level alert. Instead, someone must have overwritten the data with simulated normal driving information.  

Her thoughts raced, focused entirely on the technical challenge.  

“Do you think the other drivers have realized they’ve gone off course?” the masked girl asked, her voice still tinged with anxiety. “Can you see if anyone in the other cars is signaling or waving?”  

Everyone tried peering into the darkness, but it was too dim to make out anything.  

“Try using the hazard lights!” Wang Xia suggested excitedly.  

Meng Yu pressed the emergency light button, and the hazards began blinking. The three of them, except Xiao A, focused intently on the other cars, hoping for a response. But there was none. Their expressions grew heavier.  

“Why? Why would anyone want to kidnap so many people and vehicles at once? Have the others not noticed? Are they…dead?” The girl’s voice broke as panic set in.  

“This scale of deviation suggests a high-level insider at the central headquarters, likely a hacker or terrorist organization,” Xiao A said. “This isn’t a small matter. Ordinary hackers couldn’t achieve this from the outside. We need to bypass the traffic control system and report directly to the police.”  

The mention of the police caused Meng Yu’s expression to shift slightly. Though subtle, Xiao A caught the change. She made a mental note to stay cautious around him.  

Suddenly, the masked girl began to hyperventilate, leaning forward with tears in her eyes. Wang Xia hurriedly handed her a tissue, which she accepted with a grateful nod. She finally removed her mask, revealing her face. Wang Xia’s eyes widened in shock, but he said nothing. The girl, noticing his reaction, quickly put her mask back on and withdrew into her corner.  

Xiao A tried sending an emergency satellite message via her phone: *“Vehicle WS495N has severely deviated from its route. Please investigate.”* After a long wait, there was no response—likely due to a weak signal.  

“Maybe it’s not as bad as it seems,” Wang Xia stammered. “If enough people don’t arrive on time and can’t be contacted, their friends or family might call the police.”  

Xiao A closed her eyes, still deep in thought, trying to figure out how the hack could have been executed.  

Meng Yu suddenly pointed at the dashboard. “Look at this map. In five minutes, we’ll reach a seaside town. If we keep going, we’ll drive into the ocean within ten minutes.”  

It was already 9:23 p.m.
