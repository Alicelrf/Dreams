# Ape Matrix Notes

I don’t know where to start when I saw your question about if the short story is in the same universe of the novel. 
First of all, the novel outline I shared (blind city) was initially intended to be a short story lol. It was a side project I started to get some rest from constructing a real novel universe. It can be added to the main universe and it can be a standalone story.


Second, I can’t believe I didn’t tell you much about my dreams. I had tons of them and I had to keep a separate journal just for the interesting dreams which have the potential to be developed into stories. Many of them are good stories already. I don’t really have the skills to wrap them up nicely. That’s why I keep wondering if I should spend some time learning writing skills seriously. Last year I was sort of depressed for a while, and writing saved me from depression and emptiness. I picked a few dreams which have the potential to be connected with a few shared characters. Then I started to construct a universe to contain all the adventures.


The universe starts from 2024 when almost everyone on this planet has got a Covid variate (numbered Omega) for at least one time. And a weird disease starts to spread after a few years of incubation period: people fall into deep coma all of a sudden around the world. The main story is about what a girl experienced in coma, because the virus invaded her brain and used her imagination and desire creating a tremendous world full of adventure to lure her staying in the coma. She has to realize what she experienced is not real and she has to leave the ones she fell in love in that imagination to wake up. Of course there are experimental treatments trying to wake her up during the time, which are different sources of incentives in that imaginary world.There are two other girls, one successfully woke up and forgot everything in the coma but left some brain damage and a loss of too much memory. The third one never woke up again because she found the lover she wished to stay forever with even though she figured that was not real.  Ok timer’s off. I need to stop right here. If you want I can send the universe setup description separately later.



Third, before I dump my real story universe on your lap and confuse you with the complex settings, I just want to focus on the short story (this time it is indeed a short one) I mentioned that I was writing on the flight. The short story doesn’t have a name yet (I called it Matrix for Apes for now) nor is it finished. But I can tell you my original dream. 
In the dream I am in a university lab as a researcher, I research the behavior of great apes. After years of research I suspect I am one of them, but my colleagues don’t believe me. I was thrown into a psychiatric hospital. I was so desperate and refused to eat. Then one day, the doctor pitied me and showed me the truth of the world. The truth is: we are not the real humans we think we are. We are just different types of great apes living in VR. Real human beings put us into visual reality and use us for their social science research. At the end of the dream, I took off the VR device human researchers put on me. I looked around and I saw many many chimpanzees and gorillas, some bonobos and a few orangutans. I looked down and combed my own red hair. Yes, I am an orangutan. I sighed and also felt sort relieved: no wonder our world is so fucked up. We are not real humans at all! We are just great apes pretending to be humans.


Lol you can’t imagine how weird I felt when I woke up that morning after that dream. Am I back with the VR? What am I, a human or a great ape thought who is a human?


I love my dreams even though sometimes they scare me off. I guess now you understand better why I am so obsessed with the topic imagination and reality. Because every few days I experience this kind of short moment when I don’t know what is real. That may be also why I hold a lot of suspects on the world around me. What if I am still in a dream and I am talking to you who are my imagined friend. What if one day in real life I walk into a person looks like you and who doesn’t remember me or understand me because it’s all my imagination.






# Andy

Andy is a PhD candidate that all professors would like to have in their lab. Good undergrad marks, easy to communicate, following all the lab rules, finishing literature reviews on time, and most importantly very stable mental status with no sign of depression at all. He gets so little attention from me, his supervisor, because he is so low maintenance; also because he hasn’t got much breakthrough in his research like all of the second year PhD Candidates. 
He attends all the lab gatherings but you can easily forget he is there. He always smiles, mostly listens and occasionally asks thoughtful and insightful questions. However, it's hard to get anything closer than a light friendship from him. There is one thing he does impress me: he shows great patience and care for the animals in the lab. I bet he probably shows more feelings to the guinea pigs than to humans.


Since the war started Andy has changed. First I noticed that he smiled less and asked more difficult questions on the ethics and purpose of the main project. Then he started to skip lectures and our regular gathering. I would not be surprised that he also joined the protests like all the other students did when the war started. I also attended some but continuing the research was the highest priority to me. 
However, when the war continued, most of my students adapted to the new fact and accepted that the war was not gonna stop in a short term. Andy did not come back with the rest.
