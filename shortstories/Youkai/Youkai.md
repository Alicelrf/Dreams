# Youkai

I am a little youkai cultivated from a snow fox, with a fluffy tail and slick, snowy-white fur. Ordinary humans can't see me; I roam freely in the human world, occasionally playing pranks on people for fun.

One day, during a warm and blossoming spring weather, I wandered to a beautiful eastern-style courtyard halfway up a mountain. A clear stream flowed into a pond, and a wooden waterwheel turned slowly by its side. Next to the pond was a waterside pavilion. It seemed like a nice place to live! However, as a youkai, I had little interest in beautiful human residences. What I liked were the variety of large, well-fed carp in the pond.

I observed for a while and didn't see many people around. There was only a man dressed in light robes sitting by the pond, sipping tea and enjoying the scenery. Everyday I played with little deers and wolves in the woods, then I came over to rest and catch a few carp to satisfy my hunger.

That day, I noticed a visitor had arrived, and he was sitting by the pond with the man, sipping tea. To my surprise, from their conversation, I learned that the host was none other than the Emperor of post-war Japan. I was shocked! My first reaction was to assassinate this war criminal to seek revenge for the souls lost during the war. I cautiously approached, holding my breath. Wait a minute! Wasn't I a youkai? Why should I hold my breath? He couldn't see me. I reminded myself that I was just a youkai, and human conflicts had nothing to do with me.

With this realization, I let go of my murderous intent. However, the moment I abandoned it, the Emperor furrowed his brows as if he had sensed something amiss. He told his companion that there was an ominous aura in the courtyard. The visitor brushed it off, attributing it to passing clouds and a gust of wind. I hurriedly slipped away, realizing that the Emperor possessed a high level of spiritual power. Even as a youkai, I could risk exposure. If he decided to summon a powerful exorcist, it wouldn't end well for me.

Despite my decision to keep my distance from the Emperor, I couldn't resist the temptation of the delicious fish in the pond. I decided to only catch a few at night and not bother him anymore. However, my plans took an unexpected turn when I overheard the Emperor complaining, "Lately, there seem to be fewer fish in the pond. I wonder if stray cats have been eating them." I couldn't help but roll my eyes; the man was far too idle if he noticed a few missing fish. I was a dignified fox spirit; how could I be mistaken for a stray cat?

So, in the days that followed, I continued to visit the area, catching a few carp from nearby ponds and introducing them into the Emperor's pond. I thought this way the number of fish wouldn't decrease, and I wouldn't be accused of stealing. I lived peacefully in this picturesque place, continuing my cultivation.

Then, one day, while I was pondering which fish to eat that night by the water's edge, I suddenly heard the Emperor's voice right beside me, "Could you leave the white-bodied purple-flowered carp for me? Thatâ€™s my favorite.Thank you!"

Being startled I fell into the pond.
