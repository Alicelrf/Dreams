Food Connoisseur Qualification Exam - Round 2: Interview and Tasting

After exchanging greetings, I took my seat at a small table covered in a pristine white tablecloth. In front of me were several exquisite pieces of tableware. Three interviewers sat on a sofa about two meters away, flipping through their documents and fiddling with pens and paper.

I first picked up a small Japanese teacup adorned with a relief of plum blossoms. It was warm, and as I examined it, I guessed it was tea. Inside the teacup was a clear, pale green liquid with some irregular brown plant debris suspended in it. When I sniffed it, it strangely had a hint of coffee aroma. I couldn't help but ask, "What is this?"

One of the interviewers raised an eyebrow, appearing somewhat dissatisfied, but he still informed me, "It's a tea made by roasting Irish coffee tree roots with Japanese barley tea."

I thought to myself, "This might not be going well," so I quickly put on a serious expression and began tasting the other dishes on the small plates in front of me. I meticulously sampled each of these elegantly arranged dishes, evaluating them in my mind until I had tasted them all.

Finally, as I looked up, I suddenly noticed that the interviewers were one by one trying to suppress their impatience and displeasure. It was then that I realized I should probably have been giving them my opinions after tasting each dish. So, I calmly wiped my mouth and began offering my tasting feedback. I admitted that I didn't know the names of all the ingredients, but that didn't hinder my sharp taste buds from assessing the flavor harmony.

For instance, with the pan-fried fish, I initially detected a delightful combination of roasted and floral scents, which I suspected was due to the addition of tropical plant flower nectar in the seasoning. However, when this aroma mixed with the fish, it became somewhat peculiar, and I felt that eating more would make it cloying. Then, there was a cold dish that looked like shredded lettuce stem but had not been adequately drained, resulting in a less crisp texture. Lastly, the tea that smelled like coffee turned out to be quite intriguing; it lingered between the richness of coffee and the lightness of tea. It was my favorite among all these dishes.

I had a feeling the interview might not have gone well, but I didn't dwell on it too much. What disappointed me more was not having encountered any exceptionally amazing dishes. A prestigious global food appreciation exam should have offered samples that could truly satisfy my taste buds.

After the interview, I joined some classmates who had been training and taking the exam with me to shop for ingredients for dinner. That's when two mobile phones rang simultaneously, one of them being mine. I had to rush out of the supermarket to answer the call. Surprisingly, I had passed this round of interviews and was going on to the final round! I hung up the phone and hurried back to the supermarket, where I found my friends waiting, guarding my selections in line at the checkout. Coincidentally, another guy received a similar call. Amid congratulations and sighs, everyone teased us about being the chefs for the evening, to which we smiled and agreed. The cashier reminded us to pay, and that's when I realized I must have left my wallet at the interview location. What a day.
