Food Connoisseur Qualification Exam - Round 2: Interview and Tasting

After exchanging greetings, I took my seat at a small table covered in a pristine white tablecloth. In front of me were several exquisite pieces of tableware. Three interviewers sat on a sofa about two meters away, flipping through their documents and fiddling with pens and paper.

I first picked up a small Japanese teacup adorned with a relief of plum blossoms. It was warm, and as I examined it, I guessed it was tea. Inside the teacup was a clear, pale green liquid with some irregular brown plant debris suspended in it. When I sniffed it, it strangely had a hint of coffee aroma. I couldn't help but ask, "What is this?"

One of the interviewers raised an eyebrow, appearing somewhat dissatisfied, but he still informed me, "It's a tea made by roasting Irish coffee tree roots with Japanese barley tea."

I thought to myself, "This might not be going well," so I quickly put on a serious expression and began tasting the other dishes on the small plates in front of me. I meticulously sampled each of these elegantly arranged dishes, evaluating them in my mind until I had tasted them all.

Finally, as I looked up, I suddenly noticed that the interviewers were one by one trying to suppress their impatience and displeasure. It was then that I realized I should probably have been giving them my opinions after tasting each dish. So, I calmly wiped my mouth and began offering my tasting feedback. I admitted that I didn't know the names of all the ingredients, but that didn't hinder my sharp taste buds from assessing the flavor harmony.

For instance, with the pan-fried fish, I initially detected a delightful combination of roasted and floral scents, which I suspected was due to the addition of tropical plant flower nectar in the seasoning. However, when this aroma mixed with the fish, it became somewhat peculiar, and I felt that eating more would make it cloying. Then, there was a cold dish that looked like shredded lettuce stem but had not been adequately drained, resulting in a less crisp texture. Lastly, the tea that smelled like coffee turned out to be quite intriguing; it lingered between the richness of coffee and the lightness of tea. It was my favorite among all these dishes.

I had a feeling the interview might not have gone well, but I didn't dwell on it too much. What disappointed me more was not having encountered any exceptionally amazing dishes. A prestigious global food appreciation exam should have offered samples that could truly satisfy my taste buds.

After the interview, I joined some classmates who had been training and taking the exam with me to shop for ingredients for dinner. That's when two mobile phones rang simultaneously, one of them being mine. I had to rush out of the supermarket to answer the call. Surprisingly, I had passed this round of interviews and was going on to the final round! I hung up the phone and hurried back to the supermarket, where I found my friends waiting, guarding my selections in line at the checkout. Coincidentally, another guy received a similar call. Amid congratulations and sighs, everyone teased us about being the chefs for the evening, to which we smiled and agreed. The cashier reminded us to pay, and that's when I realized I must have left my wallet at the interview location. What a day.  




## Chapter 2

Last night, I dreamt I was taking the final exam at a culinary academy, cooking seafood. There were about 15 people in the class, each with their own workstation. On the floor of the hall, each person also had a 1.5m by 2m, half-meter-high aquarium filled with fresh seafood.

Each person had to make 4–5 dishes, including at least one soup. The required ingredients were lobster, crab, fish, and sea urchin.

A lot of people planned to make French lobster bisque, since it needs to simmer for a long time, so everyone started with the lobster. I only had crab roe steamed egg and sea urchin rice in mind—hadn’t figured out what to do with the lobster—but I went along with the crowd and tried to catch mine too. Even if I were to roast it, it’d still need time.

But the lobster in my tank was seriously huge, like twice the size of everyone else’s, and super aggressive. When I tried to scoop it up from behind with a net, it didn’t just surrender like the others—it clung to the ground and crawled away. When I tried from the front, it shot off far away. When I approached from above, it waved its giant claw at me like it was flipping me off.

With no other choice, I started working on other dishes. I quickly got a sea bass soup going and planned to also make coconut curry mussels and the crab roe steamed egg. But the lobster was a required ingredient, and I was sweating bullets.

I went back to battle the lobster. This time, it even broke my net with its claw. Furious, I grabbed a stick and whacked its head. It fought back with its claw until the claw came off…

I picked up the claw and suddenly had an idea: I’d borrow a small piece of lobster from each classmate, and use my lobster’s giant claw to complete a dish.

So I went around begging everyone for a little lobster meat. Some needed to keep their lobsters whole and couldn’t give me any, but others who had already cut theirs up gave me their smallest pieces. Like that, I managed to gather a bunch of tiny chunks of lobster meat. I stir-fried them using a spicy crawfish seasoning, then stuck the big claw upright in the center of the dish.

By the end, I only had enough time to open up the sea urchin, mix a bit of seasoning, and plate it simply. Along with the crab roe steamed egg and the fish soup I made earlier—done, and handed in!
