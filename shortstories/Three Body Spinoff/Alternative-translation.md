# Three Body Spinoff

## Chapter 1

2014.12.28

Foreword: Fortunately or unfortunately, we are all going to lose the world we are familiar with.

Waking up from a cold and lengthy dream, I didn't have to recall who I was out of thin air because I saw a familiar and caring face. Zhu Zi's face, to me, never changes because, having known her for so many years, I can always immediately see that familiar friend in her dark, shiny eyes. As long as she remains unchanged, I can smoothly find myself.

"Zhu Zi, where are we? What happened?" I found myself lying in a small compartment resembling an ambulance, with only Zhu Zi beside me.

Hearing me call her name seemed to reassure her a lot. She slightly smiled and said, "Five years ago, you were severely injured during flight training. The doctors decided to put you into cryosleep to slowly repair your body. The doctors said you've recovered about 90%, and since the whole world is now in a critical situation, they woke you up early. It's estimated that the sleep center might not be able to operate any longer. This transport vehicle will take us to where I currently live."

Her words were dense with information, instantly reminding me of numerous past flight training scenes, though I may have lost the memories from before and after the accident. Before I was injured, I remember it was still the golden age of the Deterrence Era.

"So, how do you feel now? Is there anything uncomfortable? Do you want to rest a bit more? It will still be a while before we arrive."

"I'm okay, just a bit dizzy. No worries. Tell me more about the current emergency situation."

Zhu Zi sighed, "Half a year ago, the Trisolarans made their move during the handover of the Swordholder, killing both the new and old Swordholders while also destroying the gravitational wave transmitter base."

Her first sentence stunned me, like a bolt from the blue. Zhu Zi then told me much more about the tumultuous events of the past six months. The world is no longer the one I am familiar with. Now, the Trisolaran fleet is rapidly approaching Earth, and most of the Earth's population lives in the shadow again. Security forces supported by the Trisolaran forces have infiltrated every corner of the Earth, and humanity has split into countless factions: rumors say a group of top elites have already left on private spacecraft to a newly discovered small planet; some politicians have betrayed humanity to work for the Trisolarans, further dividing human unity; some are indulging in doomsday celebrations, while others simply live in silence; even the human forces built for defense and counterattack have been infiltrated by Trisolaran spies, and internal purges have led to further division within our organization; although there are still people tirelessly trying to make amends, more and more people have given up struggling.

Thinking about humanity losing its only means of checks and balances made me feel suppressed. Do we still have a future? If not, why wake me up at all? Just let me die in my sleep.

I opened the compartment's blackout curtain to look at the familiar yet unfamiliar streets outside. Now and then, I saw homeless people lying unnoticed in corners. These homeless people seemed more numerous and more deformed than I remembered, like potted plants that were raised to die and then discarded on the street along with their pots. I occasionally saw some construction vehicles, ambulances, and police cars, but the number of small cars was much less than I remembered. However, seeing professional vehicles still operating on the streets gave me a sense of order being rebuilt.

Upon arriving at our destination, I was still seated in a wheelchair, which Zhu Zi pushed out of the vehicle. Once out of the vehicle, I saw a large construction site nearby, with construction vehicles transporting many large pieces of equipment in that direction. Some people in work clothes hurried by, while others sat on the roadside, either tired or dejected. Everyone's expression was different, each dipping from a palette of tension, excitement, fear, despair, and numbness to paint their faces.

I asked Zhu Zi, "What are they doing here? Do you live here?"

As if to answer my question, several people came over to gesture to her at that moment. Zhu Zi spoke a few words to them, and after some nods, they spoke into a walkie-talkie, and soon a sturdy-looking van appeared. With the help of those people, Zhu Zi pushed me into the van. I felt my strength gradually returning and suggested that I could walk on my own soon. But what I was most curious about now was, where is this place?

## Chapter 2

After getting on the vehicle, Zhu Zi still looked worried and hesitant to speak. She mentioned that she, along with some old friends we know, is now part of a new counteroffensive plan. This plan aims to send scientists and engineers through a U-shaped wormhole to avoid Trisolaran surveillance and continue scientific experiments, as time in this U-shaped wormhole progresses ten times faster than here. On one hand, this can significantly accelerate the development of human science and technology; on the other hand, it can preserve human civilization in some way. The U-shaped wormhole allows this advanced segment of humanity to achieve rapid scientific development in another spacetime, potentially catching up with the Trisolarans and timely returning to save the rest.

I said, "This sounds a bit like science fiction, doesn't it? What is a U-shaped wormhole, and is it reliable?"

Zhu Zi smiled and replied, "The U-shaped wormhole is actually the most reliable part. A few years ago, during the unblocked era of deterrence, physicists created a super high-energy particle collider that could finally accelerate particles to near the speed of light. These new generation particle collision experiments accidentally created a tiny wormhole. That's the U-shaped wormhole."

I asked, "Since the wormhole is tiny, how was it observed? And you mentioned that time inside it is much faster than on Earth, and it's U-shaped, is there any evidence?"

Zhu Zi explained, "You know, throughout the Deterrence Era, the scientific community was racing against time. These past few years finally saw some qualitative breakthroughs from the quantitative efforts. It's a pity that right at this critical time, the Trisolarans broke through the deterrence. Although the evidence is not entirely sufficient now, it's quite compelling since a large part of physicists admit there's a high probability of its existence. After the collision experiment, some mass was found missing. While investigating these missing particles, about a year later, a stream of high-energy particles was detected near the laboratory accidentally. There was no source of emission, and the types of particles were similar in mass to those that disappeared during the collision experiment. It led some to speculate that these particles were the ones that had vanished. This hypothesis faced a challenge because the radioactive decay of these particles was much lower than calculated values. If they were indeed particles, they must have undergone a much longer journey. Later on, scientists conducted more experiments to adjust the depth and position of creating this kind of wormhole."

"Until half a year ago..."

"Right, until half a year ago. Almost all the leading researchers were either killed or silenced. The experiments completely stopped. Now, we can only rely on theory to guide us forward."

As I went from being excited about learning of this project to feeling the unpredictable heaviness of its future, I suddenly remembered Zhu Zi saying this was the relatively reliable part and quickly asked her, "What's the unreliable part of this plan? Wait, don't tell me. You're not saying that you're planning to particle-ize people?" I scared myself with my own question. Seeing Zhu Zi not immediately rolling her eyes and saying "How could that be?" made my head spin.

Zhu Zi sighed again, "It's not particle-ization, but it's somewhat similar."

Just then, the vehicle stopped. The person driving told us, "We're here, please get off."

Zhu Zi responded, "Okay, thank you. If you're not in a hurry, please give us a few more minutes."

While I was still shocked by the absurdity of the plan, I tried to peek outside the window.

"Time is urgent, and I don't know if I can explain it clearly. I'm not even sure myself if this is right or wrong, but they'll tell you about it soon. But I wanted to tell you more, so you're somewhat prepared."

Before Zhu Zi could continue, the driver had already opened the van door, lowered the accessible ramp, and said, "Sorry, we need to pick up more people at the park entrance. Come on, I'll help you." I felt I could walk on my own now, quickly got up, thanked him for his kindness, and didn't want to hold him up. I grabbed Zhu Zi and got off the vehicle.
