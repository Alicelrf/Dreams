前言：幸或者不幸，我们都将失去所熟悉的世界。
从一个寒冷又漫长的梦境里醒来，我不用凭空去回忆自己是谁，因为看到了一张熟悉可亲的关切的脸。祝子的脸在我看来不会改变，因为认识她这么多年，从她乌黑闪亮的眼睛中我总能立刻看到那个熟悉的友人。她不变，我就能借此顺利找到自己。
“祝子，我们在哪？发生了什么？”我发现自己躺在类似救护车的小车厢里，旁边只有祝子。
听到我叫她名字，她似乎放心了很多，脸上微微带着笑意，对我说“五年前你在飞行训练中受了重伤，当时医生选择让你进入低温休眠，缓慢进行身体的修复。医生说你大概恢复了90%，因为现在全世界都事态危急，就提前把你唤醒了。估计休眠中心也不一定能运转下去。这辆转运车会把我们送到我们我现在住的地方。”
这些话信息密度很高，我瞬间想起了大量过去飞行训练的画面，不过我可能失去了事故前后的记忆。我受伤前，我记得还是威慑纪元的黄金和平年代啊。
“所以你现在觉得怎么样？有没有哪里不舒服？要不再多休息一下，还要一会儿才到。”
”我还好，就是有点晕。没事，你再说说现在的紧急局势到底怎么回事。“
祝子叹了口气，“半年前三体人在执剑人交接时动手，杀死了新老执剑人同时摧毁了引力波发射基地。” 
我听了这第一句就愣住了，宛如晴天霹雳。接下来祝子跟我说了好多好多这半年来的风起云涌。世界已经不是那个我熟悉的世界了。现在三体舰队正全速向地球驶来，大部分地球人口又生活在阴影里了。三体势力支持的治安保卫队已经渗透进了地球的各个角落，人类已经分裂成不知道多少种派别：传闻一批顶级权贵已经搭乘私人飞船走掉去一个新发现的很小行星；有的政客背叛了人类为三体做事，继续分裂人类的团结；一部分人在末日狂欢，一部分人只是沉默度日；人类构建的防御反击力量里也已经混入三体势力的间谍，并且当我们的组织在内部清理时又引发了组织进一步的分裂；虽有还有有骨气的人在奔波弥补，但越来越多的人已经放弃挣扎了。
想到人类现在失去了唯一制衡的手段，我感到一阵压抑。我们还有未来吗？没有的话，何必再唤醒我呢。就让我在沉睡中死去不就好了吗？
我拉开车厢的遮光帘，看着窗外熟悉又陌生的街道。时而看到有些流浪汉无人问津地躺在角落里。这些流浪汉看起来比记忆中的更多了，更加不成人形。好像是被人养死的盆栽，被嫌弃地连盆遗弃在街上。路上时常看到有些工程车，救护车还有警车，但小轿车的数量比记忆中少了很多。不过能看到还有专业的车辆在路上行驶，已经重建了一丝秩序感。
到了目的地，我依然是坐在轮椅上被祝子推下车的。一下车，我看到不远处有个大工地，有工程车运送着很多巨大的仪器向那边驶去。有些穿着工作服的人匆忙地路过，也有人疲劳或者颓丧地坐在路边。每个人的表情都不一样，各自从，紧张，兴奋，恐惧，绝望，麻木的调色盘里蘸取了几种涂在脸上。
我问祝子：“这是做什么呢？你现在住在这里？”
仿佛是回答我的问题一样，有几个人这时刚好走来向她示意。祝子跟他们说了几句，那些人点点头对着传呼机说了些人么，很快一个看上去就笨重结实的面包车出现了。祝子在那几个人的帮助下，把我推上了车。我感到自己逐渐恢复了体力，提出一会儿下车应该可以自己走了。但我现在最好奇的还是，这是哪里？

Preamble: Whether fortunately or unfortunately, we are all going to lose the world we are familiar with.
Waking up from a cold and lengthy dream, I don't need to recall out of nowhere who I am, because I see a familiar and affectionate face of concern. Zhu Zi's face, to me, will not change, because having known her for so many years, I can always immediately see that familiar friend in her dark, shining eyes. If she remains unchanged, I can thus smoothly find myself.
"Zhu Zi, where are we? What happened?" I found myself lying in a small compartment like an ambulance, with only Zhu Zi beside me.
Hearing me call her name, she seemed much relieved, a slight smile on her face, and she told me, "Five years ago, you were seriously injured during flight training. The doctors chose to put you into cryosleep to slowly repair your body. They say you've recovered about 90%, because the world is now in a state of emergency, they woke you up early. It's likely that the sleep center can't continue operating. This transport vehicle will take us to where I live now."
Her words were densely packed with information, and I instantly remembered many scenes from past flight training, but I might have lost the memories before and after the accident. Before I was injured, I remember it was the golden era of peace in the Deterrence Epoch.
"So how do you feel now? Is there any discomfort? Do you want to rest a bit more? It will be a while before we arrive."
"I'm okay, just a bit dizzy. No worries, tell me more about what exactly is going on with the emergency situation."
Zhu Zi sighed, "Half a year ago, the Trisolarans made their move during the handover of the Swordholder, killing both the new and old Swordholders and destroying the gravitational wave transmitter base."
I was stunned by her first sentence, like a bolt from the blue. Then Zhu Zi told me a lot more about the dramatic developments over the past six months. The world is no longer the one I knew. Now, the Trisolaran fleet is speeding towards Earth, and most of the Earth's population lives in the shadow again. The security forces supported by the Trisolarans have infiltrated every corner of Earth, and humanity has split into who knows how many factions: rumors say a group of top elites have already taken private spacecraft to a newly discovered small asteroid; some politicians have betrayed humanity to work for the Trisolarans, continuing to divide human unity; some people are reveling as if it's the end of the world, while others just silently get through the days; even in humanity's defensive counterattack forces, spies from the Trisolaran forces have infiltrated, and when our organization tries to purge them internally, it leads to further splits within the organization; though there are still honorable people trying to make amends, more and more people have given up the struggle.
Thinking that humanity has now lost its only means of balance, I felt a wave of depression. Do we still have a future? If not, why wake me up? Wouldn't it be better to just let me die in my sleep?
I pulled open the compartment's blackout curtain and looked at the familiar yet strange streets outside. From time to time, I saw some homeless people lying in corners, ignored by everyone. These homeless people looked even more numerous than I remembered, more dehumanized. Like potted plants that had been fed until they died, discarded on the street with their pots. Occasionally, I saw some construction vehicles, ambulances, and police cars, but there were fewer sedans than I remembered. However, seeing professional vehicles still driving on the road, a sense of order has been rebuilt.
Upon arriving at the destination, I was still in a wheelchair, pushed out of the vehicle by Zhu Zi. Once off the vehicle, I saw a large construction site not far away, with construction vehicles transporting many huge devices towards it. Some people in work clothes hurried by, while others sat on the roadside, either fatigued or despondent. Each person's expression was different, each dipping from a palette of tense, excited, fearful, despairing, and numb to paint their faces.
I asked Zhu Zi, "What's being done here? Do you live here now?"
As if in answer to my question, a few people came over to signal to her at that moment. Zhu Zi spoke a few words to them, and they nodded and spoke into a walkie-talkie. Soon, a sturdy-looking van appeared. With the help of those people, Zhu Zi pushed me onto the van. I felt my strength gradually returning, suggesting I might be able to walk on my own after a while. But what I'm most curious about now is, where is this place?
