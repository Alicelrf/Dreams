# Three Body Spinoff

## Chapter 1 2014.12.28

Preamble: Whether fortunately or unfortunately, we are all going to lose the world we are familiar with.

Waking up from a cold and lengthy dream, I don't need to recall out of nowhere who I am, because I see a familiar and affectionate face of concern. Zhu Zi's face, to me, will not change, because having known her for so many years, I can always immediately see that familiar friend in her dark, shining eyes. If she remains unchanged, I can thus smoothly find myself.

"Zhu Zi, where are we? What happened?" I found myself lying in a small compartment like an ambulance, with only Zhu Zi beside me.

Hearing me call her name, she seemed much relieved, a slight smile on her face, and she told me, "Five years ago, you were seriously injured during flight training. The doctors chose to put you into cryosleep to slowly repair your body. They say you've recovered about 90%, because the world is now in a state of emergency, they woke you up early. It's likely that the sleep center can't continue operating. This transport vehicle will take us to where I live now."

Her words were densely packed with information, and I instantly remembered many scenes from past flight training, but I might have lost the memories before and after the accident. Before I was injured, I remember it was the golden era of peace in the Deterrence Epoch.

"So how do you feel now? Is there any discomfort? Do you want to rest a bit more? It will be a while before we arrive."

"I'm okay, just a bit dizzy. No worries, tell me more about what exactly is going on with the emergency situation."

Zhu Zi sighed, "Half a year ago, the Trisolarans made their move during the handover of the Swordholder, killing both the new and old Swordholders and destroying the gravitational wave transmitter base."

I was stunned by her first sentence, like a bolt from the blue. Then Zhu Zi told me a lot more about the dramatic developments over the past six months. The world is no longer the one I knew. Now, the Trisolaran fleet is speeding towards Earth, and most of the Earth's population lives in the shadow again. The security forces supported by the Trisolarans have infiltrated every corner of Earth, and humanity has split into who knows how many factions: rumors say a group of top elites have already taken private spacecraft to a newly discovered small asteroid; some politicians have betrayed humanity to work for the Trisolarans, continuing to divide human unity; some people are reveling as if it's the end of the world, while others just silently get through the days; even in humanity's defensive counterattack forces, spies from the Trisolaran forces have infiltrated, and when our organization tries to purge them internally, it leads to further splits within the organization; though there are still honorable people trying to make amends, more and more people have given up the struggle.

Thinking that humanity has now lost its only means of balance, I felt a wave of depression. Do we still have a future? If not, why wake me up? Wouldn't it be better to just let me die in my sleep?

I pulled open the compartment's blackout curtain and looked at the familiar yet strange streets outside. From time to time, I saw some homeless people lying in corners, ignored by everyone. These homeless people looked even more numerous than I remembered, more dehumanized. Like potted plants that had been fed until they died, discarded on the street with their pots. Occasionally, I saw some construction vehicles, ambulances, and police cars, but there were fewer sedans than I remembered. However, seeing professional vehicles still driving on the road, a sense of order has been rebuilt.

Upon arriving at the destination, I was still in a wheelchair, pushed out of the vehicle by Zhu Zi. Once off the vehicle, I saw a large construction site not far away, with construction vehicles transporting many huge devices towards it. Some people in work clothes hurried by, while others sat on the roadside, either fatigued or despondent. Each person's expression was different, each dipping from a palette of tense, excited, fearful, despairing, and numb to paint their faces.

I asked Zhu Zi, "What's being done here? Do you live here now?"

As if in answer to my question, a few people came over to signal to her at that moment. Zhu Zi spoke a few words to them, and they nodded and spoke into a walkie-talkie. Soon, a sturdy-looking van appeared. With the help of those people, Zhu Zi pushed me onto the van. I felt my strength gradually returning, suggesting I might be able to walk on my own after a while. But what I'm most curious about now is, where is this place?

## Chapter 2

After getting on the vehicle, Zhu Zi still appeared anxious and hesitant to speak. She said that she is now involved in a new counterattack plan with some old friends we know. This plan involves sending scientists and engineers into a U-shaped wormhole to avoid surveillance by intelligent probes and continue conducting scientific experiments, where time passes 10 times faster than here. On one hand, this could significantly accelerate the development of human science and technology; on the other hand, it could preserve human civilization in some way. The U-shaped wormhole allows that part of advanced humanity to complete scientific development at an extremely fast pace in another dimension, catching up with the Trisolarans and then returning in time to save the rest.

I said, "This sounds a bit sci-fi, doesn’t it? What's a U-shaped wormhole, and is it reliable?"

Zhu Zi smiled and said, "This U-shaped wormhole is actually the most reliable part. A few years ago, during a period without Trisolaran deterrence, physicists built a super high-energy particle collider, finally able to accelerate atomic-level particles to near the speed of light. These new generation particle collision experiments accidentally created a tiny wormhole. That’s the U-shaped wormhole."

I asked, "If the wormhole is so tiny, how was it observed? And you said time inside it is much faster than on Earth, and it's U-shaped. Is there any evidence?"

Zhu Zi explained, "You know, throughout the Deterrence Era, the human scientific community was racing against time to explore. These past few years, there have finally been some qualitative breakthroughs from quantitative changes. Unfortunately, right at this critical time point, the Trisolarans broke through the deterrence. The current evidence, though not completely sufficient, is very strong—after all, a large majority of physicists acknowledge the high possibility of its existence. After the collision experiments were completed, some mass was found missing. While researching these missing particles, about a year later, a high-energy particle ray was accidentally detected near the laboratory. Since there was no source of emission and the particle types were similar in mass to those that disappeared in the collision experiments, people speculated that this ray originated from those missing particles. Another challenge to this hypothesis is that the radioactive decay of these particles was much lower than the calculated values. If it was a batch of particles, then they must have undergone a much longer journey. Later, scientists conducted more experiments to adjust the depth and location of creating such wormholes."

"Until half a year ago..."

"Right, until half a year ago. Almost all the leading researchers were either killed or silenced. The experiments completely stopped. From now on, only theory can guide us forward."

From initially learning about this project with joy, I gradually felt the weight of its uncertain future. I suddenly remembered Zhu Zi saying this was the relatively reliable part, and hurriedly asked her, "What’s the unreliable part of this plan? Wait, don’t tell me. You’re not saying you're turning people into particles?" I scared myself with my own question. After saying it, seeing that Zhu Zi didn’t immediately roll her eyes with a “How could that be possible,” I felt dizzy.

Zhu Zi sighed again, "It’s not about turning into particles, but it’s somewhat close."

Just then, the vehicle stopped. The person driving the van told us, "We've arrived, please get off."

Zhu Zi responded, "Okay, thank you. If you’re not in a hurry, please give us a few more minutes."

While I was immersed in the shock brought by the absurdity of this plan, I tried to look outside the window.

"We’re pressed for time, and I don’t know if I can explain clearly. I don’t even know myself if what we’re doing is right or wrong. They’ll tell you more in a while. But I wanted to tell you more, to prepare you a bit."

Zhu Zi was about to continue, but the driver had already opened the door of the van, lowered the ramp, and said, "Sorry, we still need to pick up someone at the park entrance. Come on, let me help you." I felt I could walk on my own, quickly got up to thank him for his kindness. Not wanting to delay his duties, I grabbed Zhu Zi and got off the vehicle.

# Chapter 3

The disembarkation point is a 10-story building on a hillside, with people constantly entering and exiting. The faces of those seen carried an expression akin to that of fervent religious followers, as if blind to the world around them. The building, which appeared newly constructed with only a cement facade and windows like black holes, commanded attention. For the first time since waking, I truly observed the sky: a cold gray-white in the evening, faintly drizzling. However, the atmosphere wasn't entirely oppressive; instead, a strong wind stirred thin clouds, lending the sky a slight transparency.

Standing at the entrance, we were asked to wait a moment before entering. Inside, many were busy transporting a crucial piece of equipment, necessitating the elevator to be held. "Wouldn't have guessed this building even had working lights, let alone an elevator," Zhu Zi remarked, noting the location's secrecy, accessible only by certain vehicles, even unknown to Zhu Zi themselves. To avoid unnecessary attention, everything but essential top-floor experiments was moved to secretive underground facilities. This building, abandoned mid-construction, was typically inconspicuous during the day.

While waiting, I broached a topic Zhu Zi had left unfinished earlier.
"Particleization doesn't directly break a person into a stream of particles. Instead, it copies and encodes the structure and connections of brain neurons, transmitting them through a wormhole. This novel technology was proposed years ago by a leading neurophysicist. The theory is that at the brink of death, the brain's energy is maximally released. The perceived slow passage of time in near-death subconsciousness, a phenomenon in human lore, is due to this energetic state, with neurons activated more deeply and broadly than in normal conditions. With proper prior labeling of neural cells, this enhanced neural signal can be used to rapidly copy the brain's structure and content during near-death. Due to the uncertainty principle, this replication, both precise and comprehensive, is destructive to the original entity. Since electric signals make humans extremely vulnerable compared to wisdom particles, once converted into electric signals, they must be immediately transmitted into the wormhole within a protected area."

Seeing my confused expression, Zhu Zi simplified: "It means killing a person, copying their brain into electric signals, and sending it through the wormhole right before they completely die."
My shocked response was an out-loud "Wtf?!" followed by a nervous laugh, "People actually believe this?"
Zhu Zi looked awkward, sharing, "The latest information I have is that a base has been established inside a U-shaped wormhole, and the first group sent has already sent back some messages. They continue their research there, needing support. Soon, they'll master the technology to rapidly design and manufacture bodies compatible with their electronic brains, enabling them to rebuild their bodies upon returning to Earth."

I listened silently as Zhu Zi spoke of the elites who believed in and participated in the experiment, considered dead in the current world with no short-term knowledge of their return. Continuous updates from the research domain suggested smooth progress, yet with ongoing sacrifices and global conflicts, fewer qualified brains were available. Nearly all A-grade candidates like me had been sent. I was awakened from cryogenic treatment because the urgency of contributing my brain's energy now outweighed waiting for my recovery to rejoin the fight. It was also timed so I could meet friends entering the experiment.

Overwhelmed by the vast information, doubts crept in: What if it was all a lie? What if these physicists and neuroscientists were in league with the Trisolarans, aiming to eliminate more humans? Those who died were just that: dead. These fears made me too scared to voice my questions. When I asked Zhu Zi if they believed, their response was slow and somewhat sad, "I don't know."

We fell into silence. "My God, they're about to send an electronic version of my brain into a wormhole for research," was all that circled my mind.

Feeling a chill while standing outside, I spotted a familiar tall figure, Zhang Yao, loudly directing a team transporting a large box-shaped piece of equipment towards the elevator. He was an old middle school classmate and neighbor, known for his loud, showy nature, whom I had always disregarded. Seeing him involved made me more suspicious of the project's legitimacy.

I noticed Peter intently looking at a tablet in a corner on the first floor. As I approached to greet him, Zhu Zi held me back, indicating Peter might be part of the next or subsequent experiments, currently under evaluation. The realization that the imminent experiment involved taking away a friend known for over a decade hit hard. Peter, a childhood friend and university classmate, seemed too close to lose to a dubious scheme. My urgent inquiries about the current and future participants left Zhu Zi hesitating, suggesting we could observe an experiment scheduled in three hours from the rooftop. Although my brain was a high-priority candidate, having just awoken from hibernation, they likely wouldn't rush me into the experiment immediately.

So, setting aside my concerns about Peter for the moment, Zhu Zi and I recklessly dashed into the closing elevator, squeezing in with those transporting the equipment. This was my first sprint since awakening, and my limbs felt clumsy; just those few steps left me gasping for breath. Zhang Yao, spotting us join the elevator, seemed displeased at first but then showed surprise recognizing me. Ignoring his expression and any attempt at pleasantries, I directly asked about the contents of the box. He explained it was a "new signal booster for the experiment, as the previous equipment didn't provide sufficient signal strength." Zhu Zi, seemingly wary of Zhang Yao, whispered to me, "It's for sending electromagnetic waves into the wormhole. There's also another part like a helmet, to be worn by the participants, protecting the brain and capturing brain signals to be preserved..." Hearing this further fueled my fears and suspicions. Initially numbed by the overwhelming theories, the tangible presence of the equipment felt like torture devices. Gripping Zhu Zi's hand tightly, as if I could crush it, Zhu Zi's tears began to fall.

Quickly, the elevator reached the 10th floor.
