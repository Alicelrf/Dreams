# Three Body Spinoff

## 2014.12.28

Preamble: Whether fortunately or unfortunately, we are all going to lose the world we are familiar with.

Waking up from a cold and lengthy dream, I don't need to recall out of nowhere who I am, because I see a familiar and affectionate face of concern. Zhu Zi's face, to me, will not change, because having known her for so many years, I can always immediately see that familiar friend in her dark, shining eyes. If she remains unchanged, I can thus smoothly find myself.

"Zhu Zi, where are we? What happened?" I found myself lying in a small compartment like an ambulance, with only Zhu Zi beside me.

Hearing me call her name, she seemed much relieved, a slight smile on her face, and she told me, "Five years ago, you were seriously injured during flight training. The doctors chose to put you into cryosleep to slowly repair your body. They say you've recovered about 90%, because the world is now in a state of emergency, they woke you up early. It's likely that the sleep center can't continue operating. This transport vehicle will take us to where I live now."

Her words were densely packed with information, and I instantly remembered many scenes from past flight training, but I might have lost the memories before and after the accident. Before I was injured, I remember it was the golden era of peace in the Deterrence Epoch.

"So how do you feel now? Is there any discomfort? Do you want to rest a bit more? It will be a while before we arrive."

"I'm okay, just a bit dizzy. No worries, tell me more about what exactly is going on with the emergency situation."

Zhu Zi sighed, "Half a year ago, the Trisolarans made their move during the handover of the Swordholder, killing both the new and old Swordholders and destroying the gravitational wave transmitter base."

I was stunned by her first sentence, like a bolt from the blue. Then Zhu Zi told me a lot more about the dramatic developments over the past six months. The world is no longer the one I knew. Now, the Trisolaran fleet is speeding towards Earth, and most of the Earth's population lives in the shadow again. The security forces supported by the Trisolarans have infiltrated every corner of Earth, and humanity has split into who knows how many factions: rumors say a group of top elites have already taken private spacecraft to a newly discovered small asteroid; some politicians have betrayed humanity to work for the Trisolarans, continuing to divide human unity; some people are reveling as if it's the end of the world, while others just silently get through the days; even in humanity's defensive counterattack forces, spies from the Trisolaran forces have infiltrated, and when our organization tries to purge them internally, it leads to further splits within the organization; though there are still honorable people trying to make amends, more and more people have given up the struggle.

Thinking that humanity has now lost its only means of balance, I felt a wave of depression. Do we still have a future? If not, why wake me up? Wouldn't it be better to just let me die in my sleep?

I pulled open the compartment's blackout curtain and looked at the familiar yet strange streets outside. From time to time, I saw some homeless people lying in corners, ignored by everyone. These homeless people looked even more numerous than I remembered, more dehumanized. Like potted plants that had been fed until they died, discarded on the street with their pots. Occasionally, I saw some construction vehicles, ambulances, and police cars, but there were fewer sedans than I remembered. However, seeing professional vehicles still driving on the road, a sense of order has been rebuilt.

Upon arriving at the destination, I was still in a wheelchair, pushed out of the vehicle by Zhu Zi. Once off the vehicle, I saw a large construction site not far away, with construction vehicles transporting many huge devices towards it. Some people in work clothes hurried by, while others sat on the roadside, either fatigued or despondent. Each person's expression was different, each dipping from a palette of tense, excited, fearful, despairing, and numb to paint their faces.

I asked Zhu Zi, "What's being done here? Do you live here now?"

As if in answer to my question, a few people came over to signal to her at that moment. Zhu Zi spoke a few words to them, and they nodded and spoke into a walkie-talkie. Soon, a sturdy-looking van appeared. With the help of those people, Zhu Zi pushed me onto the van. I felt my strength gradually returning, suggesting I might be able to walk on my own after a while. But what I'm most curious about now is, where is this place?
