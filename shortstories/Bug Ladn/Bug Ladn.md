# Bug Ladn

I stared at the dilapidated, rainbow-colored half-circular balloon arch with English words on it, trying to pronounce them. I felt as ridiculous as a stuck sound card. There was no fog, but I couldn't see the scenery behind the door, only a mosaic of colors. I shrugged and walked inside.

Inside the door, three comically shaped video game characters were gathered, playing cards and chatting. Upon closer inspection, one person had a bamboo-like body, hunched over to look at the cards as if sniffing them; its glasses weren't transparent but had painted eyeballs on them. Another person constantly twisted its head 180 degrees, alternating between two completely different facial expressions, making it impossible to look away. I almost missed that it had paper ears stuck to the sides of its head. It stared at the cards in Bamboo Person's hand with profound interest one moment, then gazed jubilantly at its own cards the next. There was also a 2D person, just a paper-cutout figure with crudely drawn features. It lacked flexible fingers to hold cards, so it had to lay them all out on the table and push forward the one it wanted to play.

When Bamboo Person and Face-Changing Person noticed me, they abandoned their card game and approached me, carrying Paper Person with them. They welcomed me in a special way (I guessed), introducing themselves as Bamboo (X), Face-Changer (Y), and Paper Person (Z).

I asked them to show me around this mysterious world. Y took the lead, exuding an air of leadership while displaying an array of emotions on its constantly changing face. I asked Y about this place, and one face said it was a place to showcase the truth of the world, while the other face claimed it was a place to display the world's hypocrisy. I was confused, so I turned to X. I had avoided talking to X because its wobbly movements reminded me of a Tube Man, which scared me. Its tremors slowed down, and after a moment of silence, it said to me, "This is a gathering of all the bugs in the world. Whenever a programmer looks at a screen, a gamer at a game, a reader at a book, or a citizen at a legal code and says, 'Oh, there's a bug,' that bug is immediately transferred here."

As we talked, I looked up and saw a nearly skeletal high-rise building with some faint textures on the facade but incomplete. They invited me to take the elevator to the first floor, but the elevator was just a frame with no floor or walls. These three characters walked in as if unaffected, and Paper Person extended its fingerless arm for me to hold onto. As soon as I grasped it, the elevator shot upward. I couldn't stand in mid-air and didn't dare to step on the edge of the elevator, so I clung to Paper Person tightly. X and Y danced and gestured as they spoke to themselves, but I was too preoccupied to listen and understand. Finally, the elevator stopped, and my feet eagerly touched the ground of the 13th floor.

Y reminded me to be careful, as the ground and walls here often glitched, causing strange things to appear or disappear suddenly. However, they still moved swiftly. X and Y led the way with their bizarre strides, while Z accompanied me cautiously. Through rooms with no doors or windows, I saw several modern, gleaming skyscrapers nearby. The glass facades reflected uniform non-existent sunlight. I was captivated by these perfect buildings for a while. Risking tripping over something, I hurried to catch up with X and Y, as they were the only ones who could explain this place. I asked, "Why don't you all move into those tall buildings? It's not safe here." X and Y laughed, "But those buildings have no entrances; that's their bug. Even when you're here, no one can find the entrances. So, everyone has to live in this trash."

In the rooms along the corridor, some were lively, while others were eerily quiet. Suddenly, a Japanese office worker appeared beside me, dressed in a shirt, trousers, holding a tie and a coat. He muttered, "I'm back," and took a step into nothingness. I tried to grab him, but he vanished. Moments later, he reappeared, in the same attire, looking exhausted and tipsy, and said, "I'm back" as he walked into his non-existent home. I watched this scene repeat several times before refocusing and continuing to follow them. Z waited for me closest to where I was. Although it was the most poorly modeled, with no expression or clothing, I felt it had a kind heart within its 2D body.

We followed them into a room filled with various characters and objects, some famous and others unheard of. I saw Link from Zelda and a wild boar seemingly dancing together, but upon closer inspection, they were just frozen in a battle scene, trembling endlessly. Suddenly, something flew by outside the window, and I recognized Harry Potter chasing a golden snitch on a broomstick. I exclaimed, "Why is Harry here?!" Y said, "Hahaha, what, you think there are no bugs in Harry Potter's world?" I was speechless, but I didn't have the chance to ask what kind of bug that was. Thinking about it, for such a massive work, it would be strange not to have any bugs.

Turning back, I saw an intensely sad woman repeatedly raising a wine glass to her lips, but the moment the glass touched her lips, it emptied, and as soon as it moved away from her lips, it refilled. Two people were discussing in front of a blackboard, one saying, "The microsystem under strong gravity can't be described by either relativity or quantum mechanics!" The other one said helplessly, "But I need a valid bank card to get a mobile number." I asked Y what they were discussing. Y said, "Bugs in theoretical physics."

A woman with a deeply saddened expression repeatedly raised a wine glass, but it emptied every time it reached her lips, only to refill when it moved away. Two people beside her were conversing, and I overheard one saying, "The concerned party needs a valid phone number to get a bank card." The other one said, dejectedly, "But I need a valid bank card to get a mobile number."

Seeing all these peculiar characters in the room, I began to feel a bit overwhelmed. I told XYZ that I wanted to go outside for a walk, so they led me out of the building, away from the dense skyscrapers, and into an open area. I looked up and saw a roller coaster track high above, with a roller coaster car stuck at the moment before a drop because the lower part of the track had disappeared.

As we walked, the ground suddenly became soft. Was it sand? In an instant, the ground vanished beneath my feet, and I began to fall! Did the ground collapse, or did it disappear? In the next moment, X, with its long arms and legs, reached out and pulled me back up, saving me from a fall. Back on solid ground, I looked at the spot where I had just stood and realized it was a Minecraft gravel bug. I sincerely thanked X, never expecting that I would be saved by the elongated Tube Man. Y and Z

 approached, and Y asked, "Are you okay?" One face showed concern, while the other displayed excitement. I struggled to face Y because it had two faces simultaneously, making it impossible for me to muster an appropriate expression or reaction. Z simply patted my shoulder.

Brushing off the sand from my clothes, I told XYZ, "I made plans with a friend to play tennis before lunch. Thank you for showing me this world, but I need to go back now." Hearing my words, Z lowered its head, and both faces of Y burst into laughter. I looked at X for help, and it gave me a slightly pitying look and said, "Do you ever wonder why you ended up here?"
