# Alice's Condition

## Chapter 1: Prelude

"Drip—drip—drip—"

The monitor emitted a steady sound. The sunset outside the hospital room window splashed everywhere like freshly squeezed orange juice.

A boy in a thin black sports jacket was eating takeout at the table by the window in the three-person hospital room, with the scent of cilantro mixed with chili oil drifting through the room.

The nurse, who had been standing all day and was about to change shifts, walked in as usual for the rounds, "It's you again, what smells so good?"

"Um," the boy swallowed a mouthful of soup, "Getting off work? There's a new Lanzhou noodle place downstairs, 60% off today."

"How's patient in bed 19? What about her parents?" The nurse walked over to bed 19 by the door, pulled back the eyelid of a short-haired girl, shone a light, and saw that the pupil's reaction to light was very slow.

"Alice hasn’t changed much. Her dad came early in the morning to wait for Dr. Wu's rounds, and her mom was here in the afternoon. I just came to replace her so she could go home for dinner, and she said she'd come back later to check on her," the boy said, removing the cilantro and throwing it into a plastic bag.

"You guys are close, huh?"

"Heh, we've known each other since kindergarten, our parents are colleagues."

"Childhood sweethearts, huh," Xu Feng listened to the short-haired girl's breathing with a stethoscope, both lungs sounded very clear.

"Stop it, we used to fight all the time when we were kids." The boy's face was full of bitter memories, clearly having lost more than won.

"By the way, Sister Feng, CC has been here for almost a week now and the viral load hasn’t gone down yet, when can she wake up?"

"Is CC in bed 20? Ah, it's hard to say, this new virus is very cunning, post-operative reactions vary from person to person. Just be patient a bit longer," she said, checking the blood pressure and pulse on the monitor for bed 19 and filling out the case file. "This Alice in bed 19 seems to have the best chance of waking up first, she underwent a virus clearing operation as soon as she arrived, and Dr. Wu is very satisfied with the results, now her serum is almost virus-free."

"I heard there's a cure abroad. Any news on when it might be approved?" The boy put down his soup bowl.

"Nothing yet, but if the phase III trial results from the U.S. are not falsified, approval here should be quick. Heard that a VIP’s daughter got infected, this drug might even be covered by health insurance," Xu Feng said, checking the color of the urine bag.

Then the nurse walked to the bed of the patient in bed 20, checked the long-haired girl's pupils, still no response. The girl's skin was sickly pale, with delicate features and long eyelashes. "Is she your girlfriend?"

The boy's expression dimmed, but he still managed a bitter smile, "Yes, if she can wake up, if she still remembers me," he said, picking up the plastic bowl and gulping down the remaining soup.

The sunset was completely swallowed by the silhouette of the city. The big news of the past two weeks was the sporadic reports of patients waking up both domestically and abroad, but even those who woke up exhibited various degrees of memory disorder or loss, and abnormal emotions. No one knows what they experienced while unconscious, or if they will ever return to their former selves.

Xu Feng sighed lightly, then went to fill out forms, discovering that the pen hanging from the case file gradually stopped writing, shaken a few times but still out of ink. She searched her chest pocket, empty, "Annoying, who borrowed my pen again and didn't return it. Hey, do you have a pen?"

"Yes!" The boy snapped back to reality, hurriedly picked up his backpack from the ground, took out a brand new ballpoint pen, and handed it over.

"Thanks." Xu Feng took it and continued to fill out CC's case file. The pen was a smooth triangular prism, one side engraved with "Wuhan University." "You're still studying?" Looking at the boy's young and clean face without much of a student's air, not bad-looking, with a fairly straight nose. Then she walked towards the bed at the very end, bed 21.

"I've been working for two years. I took time off to come here these few days; CC's family lives far away, and her parents couldn't come right away. Unexpectedly, I found out the day before yesterday that Alice also got infected. But after this week, I can only come to see them on weekends."

The girl in bed 21 was actually the first case to arrive and has been here for two weeks already. Xu Feng still remembers the day she was brought into the ward with a respirator. Other nurses said that it was company colleagues who had brought her in, and since then, no family or friends had come to visit, and her condition showed no improvement. After completing the routine check and filling out the case for bed 21, Xu Feng said, "That's good, if you have time these next few days, talk more with Alice in bed 19, read to her or something. I think these next few days are critical. If she wakes up, she'll be the first case in our city to recover naturally." Saying this, Xu Feng casually placed the pen in her chest pocket, then remembered the pen wasn't hers and laughed, intending to return it to the boy.

"It's okay, you can keep it. I don't need it," he said.

"Thanks. What's your name?" Xu Feng, satisfied, clipped the pen to her pocket, ready to leave.

"Wow... Sister Feng, you didn't know my name?" Seeing the boy feigning a hurt expression, Xu Feng felt a bit embarrassed. "I'm Guan Zeyu, call me Peter."

"Okay, bye Peter, I'm off to eat," Xu Feng had just walked past the middle bed when she noticed a slight change in Alice's heart rhythm. Thinking she saw it wrong, she quickly went over for a closer look.

"Sister Feng, what's wrong?"

"Did you see that? Alice seemed to have a reaction. What were you just talking about?" Xu Feng started searching her pocket for a flashlight.

"I was saying my full name."

"Ha, she seemed to react to your name?"

Peter immediately stood up, almost knocking over the empty bowl, and quickly walked over to bed 19. He loudly said, "Alice, can you hear me? I'm Peter." A second, two seconds, three seconds passed, but Alice's pupils didn't react, and there was no change in the heart rhythm graph.

Xu Feng said, "Maybe the reflection made me see it wrong. Ah, don't be too anxious, it's only been two days. Theoretically, it generally takes three to five days to regain consciousness." She then put away the flashlight into her pocket.

Peter nodded, unwilling to give up, he repeated his name to Alice several times. His friend was right there in front of him, but her consciousness seemed to have fallen into a kilometer-deep well, with no response. "Forget it, go have your meal."

Xu Feng turned and walked towards the door.

Just then, Peter saw Alice's heart rhythm chart suddenly spike!

"Holy shit! Holy shit, Alice you foodie!" Peter's face was full of disbelief.

"What happened?" The nurse turned around at the door and asked.

"It's... not my name, she reacted to the words 'go eat'... (￣△￣；)"

Alice's heart rhythm chart moved again.
