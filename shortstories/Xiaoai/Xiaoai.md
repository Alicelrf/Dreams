# Xiaoai

## Chapter One: self introduction

It was the end of summer, and the typhoon had almost passed. The weather was overcast with a light rain and a gentle breeze. It had been more than a day since the incident occurred.

I walked towards my apartment with Xiaoai, an 8-year-old girl by my side. My place was on the top floor, the easternmost unit of a decades-old Khrushchev-style building. Even though it had rained, the outlines of the two bodies on the ground were still visible. There were three or four people in uniforms outside the apartment entrance, one talking on the phone, and a few measuring the traces on the ground. None of them had umbrellas. Seeing this, the child beside me huddled closer to my side, and I gently put my arm around her shoulder, tilting the umbrella towards her.

As we approached the entrance of the apartment, I deliberately shielded my face as I closed the umbrella, avoiding their gaze. Just as I was about to hurry inside the building, someone called out to us. I turned around to see two police officers and a community security guard. Xiaoai gripped my hand even tighter. The security guard greeted me, saying, "Hey, thank you for taking care of Xiaoai yesterday. The police are contacting her relatives. Can she stay with you for another couple of days?" I put on a carefully considered expression, showing a hint of sadness and sympathy, and then smiled a little, politely saying, "It's nothing, we're neighbors; it's the least I can do for her."

I noticed that one of the two police officers, the younger one, seemed very familiar, like I had seen him somewhere before. His gaze at me appeared pensive as if he also recognized me for some reason. I didn't dare to hold his gaze for long and averted my eyes. At this moment, the young police officer introduced himself, "Hello, I'm PH, an officer from the Criminal Division of the Public Security Bureau. This is our veteran detective, Officer Feng." I also introduced myself, saying, "Hello, I'm L. I'm Xiaoai’s neighbor next door. She stays with me for now." The older police officer commented, "Is it really a good idea for her to stay next to the scene of the incident? She must be quite traumatized." I didn't know how to respond at once, so I just said, "She often comes over to my place to play; she's quite attached to me."

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the older police officer, seemingly scrutinizing me for a moment and then shifting his gaze to Xiaoai. I lowered my head and saw the little girl, who had lowered her head and was hiding behind me, looking fragile and dependent. I guessed that the old detective had also sensed her reliance on me, and I felt that the gaze directed at me had warmed up a bit. In reality, I was quite anxious; my acting skills were far from Xiaoai’s guise. Fortunately, she was smart and insightful, or else I wouldn't have been able to handle this pressure. Thinking about how this child had become this way, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness.

After exchanging a few more pleasantries with the police and security guy, Xiaoai and I finally entered the apartment building.


## Chapter 2: The Missing Bodies (PH's Perspective)

On the day the typhoon passed through, it was July 19th. While the eye of the typhoon was passing over, colleagues at the police station received a distress call, reporting the discovery of two bodies beneath an old residential building. Despite having been stranded by the typhoon earlier, I managed to return to the station just as the rain and wind subsided, then I hurried to the scene with a colleague. The journey there was quite challenging as the first round of the typhoon had damaged the power supply in the vicinity, leaving the streets without any streetlights. Eventually, we navigated through the chaotic layout of the neighborhood and reached the building.

The bodies laying there seem to be of a middle aged couple, illuminated by flashlights held by a few courageous residents from the community. My colleague secured the area, and I captured images of the bodies, outlining their positions. It appeared they had fallen from above, rigor mortis had already set in, indicating they had likely been deceased for over an hour, which coincided with the peak of the first round of the typhoon. Before we could complete our tasks, the calm of the typhoon's eye came to an end. Fierce winds and heavy rain returned, causing nearby power poles to sway dangerously. We had no choice but to retreat inside the building, using this time to investigate the identities of the deceased.

Although this old community was run-down, its location was desirable, which meant most residents were migrant workers from various places, and there weren't many long-term residents left. People didn't know each other very well, so I had to go door-to-door on each floor based on the location of the bodies to inquire. Some apartments were vacant, while others claimed not to recognize the victims. When we were nearing the top floor, we finally encountered a family who recognized the deceased as the couple living directly above them. They mentioned that this family was incredibly noisy and disrupted their sleep. They had even tried to negotiate when they first moved in, but it was futile. The upstairs neighbors continued to have frequent loud arguments and noisy disturbances. They mentioned that there seemed to be a young girl in that family, who rarely came downstairs to play with other children, so she wasn't well-known.

Armed with this critical information, we quickly ascended to the top floor. This old Khrushchyovka-style building resembled a motel, with each floor sharing a corridor. On one side of the corridor was an approximately 1.2-meter-high outer railing, and on the other side were the entrances to each apartment. The top floor was pitch black, but in the beam of our flashlights, we saw that the door of the family we were looking for was wide open, swaying with the storm. My colleague and I entered hastily, finding the interior in disarray, though we couldn't tell if it was due to a break-in or if it was always this cluttered. We frantically searched for the young girl and finally discovered her unconscious in a corner of her room. I picked her up, intending to take her to the hospital.

Just then, we heard commotion from outside, even louder than the raging storm.

The bodies had disappeared.


## Chapter 3: The Feeling of Heartbeat

July 20th. 

Early in the morning, 9 hours after the bodies went missing, the police surrounded the building. They continued to inquire the residents in the building and the neighborhood.

PH asked, "Officer Feng, what do you think of this case?"

Detective Feng replied firmly, "Murder."

PH nodded, "The body disappeared right before my eyes, so I can't help but agree. But what could be the motive for this murder? The family was deeply in debt, so it doesn't seem like a financial motive. Could it be a loan shark or drug dealer? It seems like a vendetta, but the killer spared the child, thank god. Regardless of the motive, they staged a suicide by jumping from the building. So why steal the body?"

Detective Feng pondered for a moment and said, "I can't currently guess why the killer committed the murder, but if they stole the body, it's because the real method of the crime holds crucial information pointing to someone involved."

PH agreed, "You're right. Finding the body is our top priority now. Without key evidence, even if we find a suspect, we can't convict them."

"What about the child? Has she said anything yet?"

"That child seems to have suffered significant psychological trauma. The doctor found bruises on her body, some old, some recent. It's possible she was injured and unconscious shortly after the incident. I took her to the hospital last night, and she should still be there. The social relations investigation team hasn't made much progress, and we haven't located any other relatives. Currently, a neighbor is looking after her at the hospital."

"I want to meet this child. At the moment, she and the indoor crime scene are our two breakthrough points."

"Yes," PH nodded, recalling his experience of getting soaked in the rainstorm last night. "Last night's storm caused a power outage in the neighborhood, and since they live on the top floor, there likely weren't any reliable witnesses."

"Wait a minute, didn't you say that the neighbor lives right next to them? Didn't she hear anything?"

"I asked her last night, but she claimed to be asleep and said she didn't hear anything. I even woke her up with loud knocking on her door, but she wasn't fully awake. It couldn't have been her; she's so thin. How could she have dealt with a body just minutes ago, run up to the 9th floor, and then slept so soundly without anyone noticing?"

"Hmm... Was your knocking louder than thunder? If there was no thunder, she shouldn't have been sound asleep, and she might have heard noises from next door."

PH, for the first time, couldn't fully agree with Detective Feng's line of thinking, but he also couldn't reveal the whole truth. He felt like he had seen that child and the young lady next door somewhere before, but he couldn't recall it. When he opened the door next last night and saw the person who answered, his mind seemed to go blank.

Was it the feeling of attraction? He shook his head, quickly pushing away thoughts unrelated to work.


## Chapter 4: Goodnight

7.19.

What happened felt like a dream. The eye of the typhoon had passed not long ago, and another fierce storm had begun. Standing behind the door, drenched from head to toe, my hands were still trembling, and I couldn't think of anything. My mind was filled with recent chaotic images - the flooded hallway, the pounding doors in the wind, the lifeless body glimpsed in the lightning. I forced myself to stop these frantic thoughts and took a hot shower before lying down on my bed.

Strangely, among all the intense scenes, what occupied the most important place in my heart was a sensation - the feeling of the warm scalp and roots of the hair of Xiaoai, who was equally soaked when I held her. After the initial impulse, should I be afraid, regretful, or guilty? It was too late for any of that; the police could arrive at any moment.

When I opened the prescription sleeping pills, I noticed that I had a lot less left. I had received a month's supply just last week, but now there were less than three days' worth. I sighed. Well, I had entertained thoughts of suicide just now, and the pills had disappeared. At least let me get a good night's sleep tonight.

Goodnight, Xiaoai. You're free now. With that thought, I drifted off into a deep sleep.


## Chapter 5: The Hospital

Xiaoai lay quietly on the hospital bed; she had always been a quiet child. This silence was a self-learned ability to protect herself from being noticed. A young woman sat by the window, gently stroking the little girl's head. It felt just as warm and soft as that night, but now it was dry.

As she touched her, the young woman felt a scar on Xiaoai's head, a place where hair no longer grew. In the girl's mind, a series of voices echoed:

"Who do you think you are? Say it again, I dare you! You worthless wretch! How dare you come here and lecture me!" The angry man's voice mixed with drunken slurs, followed by the sound of a chair crashing to the floor, a woman's screams, and furious curses, along with the crashing of many things. Bang! It was the sound of a bottle and a hard object colliding, followed by the shattering of glass.

Then, as she examined Xiaoai's cheek more closely, she seemed to hear more voices:

The sound of shattered porcelain suddenly interrupted the cheerful shouts and laughter from a card game. "You useless brat, can't even do this right! Why don't you just die? And you dare to glare at me! Get lost! You consume everything I have, and you don't appreciate it at all." The woman's voice was full of anger, followed by a series of unbearable insults. After a moment of silence, there was a crisp slap. But there was no crying; there was never any crying. The child had learned that crying would not bring sympathy or warmth from the adults; it would only make them angrier. But she was really tired, and that slap had made her lose her balance, causing more bowls to shatter. "Stop making noise! Clean up quickly, don't disturb us," the irritable and loud man's voice followed, then cheerful voices, "Let's continue, who played a pair of Aces just now?"

The bruises that remained on Xiaoai's arm:

"Tell me, did you steal the money? Who gave you the courage to steal money at such a young age?" The man shouted angrily. "I didn't, it wasn't me!" The child rarely voiced resistance. "If it wasn't you, then who could it be?" The woman's mocking voice was sharp and nauseating. Snap! It was the sound of a belt striking flesh.

The young woman couldn't bear to continue. Those two scoundrels deserved their fate.

In her half-awake state, Xiaoai felt a long-lost tenderness. Was it her mother? But they had said her mother had died of illness a few days ago; it must be a lie. She had been waiting for her to come and pick her up. But if her mother were alive, she would surely come for her, right? Where could her mother be? The image and voice of her mother had gradually become hazy. Three years ago, her mother had left one night, unable to endure her father's drinking, gambling, and abuse. She used to call occasionally, and if the call disconnected after two rings, it meant it was her mother. She would call back. But her mother hadn't called in a long time.

In the past few months, the only source of warmth in her life had been the older sister of their neighbor. Since she had moved in, she had taught her homework, taken her to the bubble tea shop where she worked, and helped her disinfect her wounds. But she had told her that she would be returning to school in September and moving back to the dorms. Even that last glimmer of hope was gone. She wished the older sister could take her away. But even her own mother hadn't come to pick her up.

Mother, please don't go.

The young woman wiped away the tears that had welled up in Xiaoai's eyes, once again drowning in deeper self-blame. Why couldn't she have saved her sooner? Thinking this, her tears continued to fall. She stood up, turned away, stifled her sobbing, and didn't want to wake the child.

Outside the window, she heard indistinct conversations and saw a dark figure against the frosted glass, accompanied by a doctor in a white coat. The tall, dark figure looked somewhat familiar, but she didn't dare go out to investigate; she could only carefully discern it through the frosted glass.

After the dark figure left, the doctor came in. At this point, Xiaoai was awake, and the doctor checked her condition, saying that she was doing okay and there were no major issues. Xiaoai insisted on going home with the young woman. The young woman asked the doctor where to pay the fees. The doctor replied not to worry, as a man had just come in and paid the bills specifically for Xiaoai. He had wanted to visit her but left when he heard she was resting.

Who could that man be? The young woman's mind was filled with thoughts of that shadowy figure.


## Chapter Six: Before Going to the hospital

The alarm went off. 

I woke up, and it took me a while to fully come to my senses. I looked at my clock, 7am July 20th, a Saturday. Today is my rotation at work. Suddenly, countless thoughts flooded my mind. Where was Xiao Ai, and was she okay? How had she managed it? Yes, it was the sleeping pills; she must have taken them. So, that's how she had made her dad and stepmother unconscious last night? Regardless of the circumstances, I had helped her commit murder. What should I do? Should I turn myself in? If I did, how long would be my sentence? Xiao Ai was only eight years old, and though she didn't bear criminal responsibility, how could she grow up healthy with such a past? Of course, if her parents hadn't died, Xiao Ai would still be in that hell. Thinking about it, I regretted not taking her away before all of this happened. If only I were stronger and more decisive. This should never have been left to a child to resolve. How could I blame her?

Summoning my courage, I went downstairs. After such an incident, I had no idea how many of the neighbors would continue living here. The bodies were no longer there, only the outlines drawn by the police remained. I avoided the curious gazes of everyone and continued on my way to the bubble tea shop where I worked. Would the police think it was a case of suicide? Would they discover it was actually murder? If they thought it was murder, who would they suspect? Could I live the rest of my life without them suspecting me? My mind was overwhelmed.

After yesterday's typhoon, the neighborhood was in disarray, with people cleaning up scattered branches and overturned trash cans. The air was still saturated with excessive moisture, mingling various odors. I had forgotten how I had reached the bubble tea shop, but I changed into my work uniform. My colleague, Eleanor, greeted me with her usual sweet smile, "Alice, good morning! Hey, you look like you didn't get much sleep. You didn't catch a cold from getting soaked yesterday, did you?" I flashed a forced a smile as I prepared the ingredients for making tapioca. "No, it's fine, I just didn't sleep well. We need to restock the milk here; please get a container from the back for me."

We needed to prepare enough fresh tapioca and cut enough fresh fruit before the first batch of customers arrived. Typically, the crowd would pick up around noon and get busier in the afternoon. I forcefully directed all my attention to work - boiling sugar water, adding various starches, stirring while cooking. Then, taking it out, kneading it into the tapioca starch, cutting it into strips, pieces, rolling it into balls, and cooking again. By the time this whole process was finished, several hours had passed. During this time, Eleanor managed the front counter, and we finally reached the lunch break.

"Alice, Alice, did you even hear what I just said?"

"Sorry, what did you say? I wasn't paying attention."

"Wow, you really are spaced out. You're not running a fever, are you?" Eleanor reached out and felt my forehead, then touched her own. "I just told you, the police officer who got stuck here during the first round of the typhoon came by to check if we'd secured the sign outside."

"Police officer? What police officer?" When I heard the word "police," my heart skipped a beat, and I became alert. Only then did I process what she had said.

"The one who was stuck here during the typhoon yesterday! He's really nice! Do you think he likes me? He's quite good-looking. Oh, by the way..."

I genuinely had no idea what she was talking about, but seeing Eleanor launch into her own little monologue, I didn't bother interrupting her.

At that moment, I received a call from an unfamiliar number. "Hello, is this Xiao Ai's guardian? Please come to the pediatric ward at First Hospital urgently." "Doctor, how is she?" "Don't panic; she's not in a life-threatening condition. But I'm not a doctor..."

This phone call snapped me back to the harsh reality. I quickly removed my work uniform. "Eleanor, I'm so sorry, the hospital just called and said Xiao Ai is in the hospital. I have to go see her!" "Huh? She was perfectly fine yesterday. What happened to her? What about her parents?"

I couldn't answer any of these three questions. I was momentarily at a loss. But how did she know that Xiao Ai was fine yesterday? "I don't have time to explain right now. I'll tell you later!" I grabbed my bag and rushed out of the shop.


## Chapter Seven: A Shadow in the Sunlight

As we entered the apartment building, I felt a slight relief. I let go of Xiao Ai's hand and realized my palms were sweaty. Xiao Ai looked up at me, her eyes showing both concern and a level of maturity not typical for her age. I smiled, trying to reassure her, and she mischievously blinked. I turned around to glance at the three figures from a distance, and the silhouette of the young police officer suddenly struck me. Just now, in my nervousness, I hadn't recognized him.

It was the same figure I had seen at the hospital through the frosted glass, it had to be him. As if sensing my gaze, he turned to look in our direction. We locked eyes for a moment, and I panicked, turning to head into the building. Xiao Ai seemed to sense something and quietly asked, "Sis, do you know that police officer? I think he was the one who took me to the hospital the night before yesterday." I said, "Well, when I visited you at the hospital, he seemed to have been there as well. He even covered some of your medical expenses."

Apart from the hospital visit, where else had I seen him? I felt there was more to our connection than just that vague encounter. Lost in thought, I suddenly noticed Xiao Ai waving her hand in front of my face. "Hey, sis, do you like him?" Her question caught me off guard. "No, it's just that..." I trailed off before saying that I think I've seen him somewhere before. I felt like I was only making it sound more suspicious. This back-and-forth only fueled Xiao Ai's curiosity. "Sis, you're blushing!" I responded with silence.

The elevator was still not working, and we finally reached the top floor after climbing the stairs, both of us sweating. As we looked down the hallway, a heavy silence settled between us. The warm and light-hearted atmosphere from earlier had disappeared.

Yes, we were both murderers.

I quickly lowered my head to find my keys and unlock the door. I couldn't bring myself to make eye contact with Xiao Ai. Why couldn't I? I didn't know how she was coping with all of this; after all, she was just a child. I should talk to her and share some of the burden. But it seemed like I was the one who couldn't handle it. Did she really have no feeling of burden or guilt? Yeah, to be fair, she had never experienced a good day under their control. But were they truly deserving of death?

We entered the apartment, closed the door, and locked it. Leaning against the thin door panel, I couldn't help but let out a sigh. This sigh caught Xiao Ai's attention.

In a hushed voice, she said, "Sis, the neighbors told me that the police couldn't even find their bodies. There must be some higher power helping us." I replied softly, "But without bodies, it might be more suspicious." Xiao Ai held my hand and reassured me, "Sis, don't worry, no one suspects us." She continued, "I really appreciate what you did for me that day. If you hadn't come back and the chair hadn't broken, I had no idea what to do."

Looking at Xiao Ai's clear eyes, I wasn't sure if she was genuinely thanking me or subtly reminding me that we were in this together. This thought sent shivers down my spine, and I involuntarily withdrew my hand from her grasp, saying, "I'll go cook. You can watch cartoons for a while." I quickly headed to the kitchen.

Finally alone in the kitchen, I heard Xiao Ai turn on the TV to watch her favorite anime, Detective Conan. Detective Conan, I put up a bitter smile thinking of the anime. So, the two of us are like those faceless shadows in the anime, aren't we? I turned on the exhaust fan, sat down on the floor, and began to cry, as quietly as I could. What should I do? How am I going to handle this? Is this how I'll spend the rest of my life, consumed by this guilt?

At that moment, I didn't know that Xiao Ai was hiding by the kitchen door, secretly listening to me crying beneath the sound of the exhaust fan.

## Chapter Eight: New Evidence

“Come in!” Officer Feng said as he handed over a report to PH. 

"Take a look at this. It's a report just sent from the forensics lab. They found a high concentration of sedative drugs in a water cup from the crime scene,"

"Roofied? Could it be that one of the victims left them in the cup on a previous day?" PH asked while swiftly scanning through the report summary and examining the scanned images of the crime scene and test results.

Officer Feng added, "Look at the last page, the lab-work; this drug isn't the kind meant to be dissolved in water; it's originally in capsule, and it's a prescription medication. I checked with the investigative team, and they didn't find any prescription bottles in their apartment." The experienced old detective seemed particularly excited, perhaps because of this new evidence.

"So, it's highly likely the victims were drugged and lost consciousness, then thrown from the top floor, right? Are there any unfamiliar fingerprints on the cup?"

"Since we haven't found the bodies yet, we compared it with common items in the room. No unfamiliar fingerprints. However, if the killer was wearing gloves, it would solve that problem," Officer Feng said, waving his hand and continuing to pace around the room. "Assuming the cause of death was drugging and falling from the top floor, the profile of the killer is entirely different from what we initially thought—violent criminals, loan sharks, or the underworld. Poisoning suggests that the killer was someone known to the victims. Poisoning is almost certainly the choice of a physically and psychologically disadvantaged offender, and the majority are females."

PH admired Officer Feng's keen and experienced investigative skills. "The victims known to the offender are vulnerable and female. That's probably just the child. I found out during my investigation that the two victims treated the child very poorly, constantly abusing her. Moreover, the female victim wasn't the child's biological mother. But how could an 8-year-old child throw two adults from the top floor, unless someone helped her?"

"And there's that female college student living next door alone. Didn't we just see her this afternoon? I felt like she was acting a bit evasive," Officer Feng said.

PH thought about the young woman they had met that afternoon and shook his head. He believed it would be difficult for her alone to throw two unconscious adults from the building. Wait a minute, didn't I question her on the night of the crime scene investigation to find eyewitnesses? Why did I forget such an important detail? PH began recalling the events of the night. He had undergone specialized training, and he should have remembered crucial details vividly, but there were strange gaps in his memory regarding this young woman.

Officer Feng noticed PH's contemplation and said, "When you were investigating the scene that night, didn't you meet this female college student?"

PH replied, "Yes, I had just arrived at the scene, finished drawing the outline of the body, and the second typhoon started. We had to retreat into the building. I started asking the neighbors for information about the victims. At that time, we thought it was a suicide by jumping off the building, and the rain was particularly heavy, so there was little protection for the bodies. Once I learned the identity of the victims, I rushed to their apartment and saw the unconscious child. Just as I was about to take her to the hospital, I heard someone shouting that the bodies were missing."

"When did you meet the neighbor then?"

"As soon as I heard the bodies were missing, I realized it might be a murder, so I requested backup from the police station. Because of the weather, my colleagues took a while to arrive. I couldn't leave the crime scene, so I called 120 to arrange for an ambulance to take care of the child. While waiting for the ambulance, the child was temporarily taken care of by a woman in the building. Then, I started knocking on the door of the neighboring female college student. Since there were only two families on the top floor, I was very eager to find out if she heard any unusual sounds. I knocked for quite some time before someone opened the door. She appeared to have just woken up with messy hair and claimed to have been sleeping for the past few hours, hearing nothing."

PH hesitated for a moment, thinking, "Does a normal college student sleep so early and soundly?” But he didn't bring up this question with Officer Feng. "But from the time I arrived on the top floor to the moment the bodies disappeared, she didn't have the time or opportunity to escape my notice and run off to deal with the bodies. That corridor and the stairs were the only ways for her to go downstairs. I still don't know her alibi for the time of the crime, but she does provide an alibi for the time when the bodies disappeared."

Officer Feng agreed, saying, "The neighborhood had a power outage due to the typhoon, and all the old street surveillance cameras weren't working. Nobody knows how the bodies magically disappeared. With the current evidence, we have no prime suspect, but I can't shake off the feeling that the female college student is somewhat suspicious. She and the child might both be involved in this case. That said, we can't officially interrogate her at the moment. Tomorrow, you should pay her another visit, but don't raise her suspicions. If she's indeed involved in the crime, she might have accomplices. We still haven't found the bodies, and if we alert them now, it might make it harder to locate them."

PH nodded in agreement and got ready to leave Officer Feng's office. 

At that moment, Officer Feng's attention was drawn to a pile of photos from the victims' homes on his desk. He picked up one particular photo and gestured for PH to come over. PH followed his gaze and saw a typical office chair with wheels in the top left corner of the photo. However, it was slightly tilted because one of the wheels had come off.


## Chapter Nine: The Choice

With a start, I stared at the plump lady who had appeared in the living room, unsure how to respond. The lady is dressed in a low cut dress and her boots are of impressive size. What was she doing here? How much had she overheard? Would she tell the police? 

"If you don't like how things played out, you may find the past is more malleable than you expect. If you want to learn more, come to this address before midnight tonight. Wait longer, and I won't be able to help you," she said.

With that, she pulled out a slender eyebrow pencil and a pristine white napkin from her handbag and quickly wrote down an address. She left the napkin on the coffee table and strode confidently back through the front door.

Alice and I both stood there in shock, unable to say a word. What was she talking about? The past was malleable? What did that mean? It all still seemed surreal. As we continued to stare at the front door she'd passed through, from the corner of my eye, I could see Alice struggling to hide her joy. I knew it, she regretted helping me.

Picking up the napkin, I caught the scent of lingering perfume. As I presented it to Alice I asked, "Sis, if she can really change what's happened, would you still help me this time?"

She looked thoughtful, and led me to the sofa, taking a moment to gather her thoughts, "Xiao Ai, I don't think I can bear the burden of this guilt. I'm sorry. If there's a chance to start over, I hope neither of us has to have blood on our hands." She continued, "I don't want to help you by resorting to murder, I want to find another way to take you away from them. To take you away from here."

I wasn't surprised, she had already done so much for me, and now she was carrying a burden that wasn't hers. But I couldn't believe in the future she spoke of. "How will you take me away? You're still renting and studying here."

"I'll graduate next year, and then I can move to a distant city to find a job. I can secretly bring you along if we get a chance to start over."

I hung my head in silence.

Alice sighed, "Alright, I think she was just talking. Don't dwell on it. Let's make dinner, and after that, I have to go work at the milk tea shop. Oh, I forgot to buy soy sauce on the way back. I'll go to the convenience store in the neighborhood to get some. You can watch some cartoons while I'm gone."

I pretended to agree, turning on the TV. However, when she left, I was worried that she might go to the landlady to change the past, so I quietly followed. I maintained a distance, maybe 50 meters, and she didn't notice me. She passed by the basketball court in between our apartment and the convenience store, where a group of people seemed to be playing a game with a few onlookers closely watching them play. 

The road in the neighborhood was narrow, and the edge of the basketball court was just a few meters away. As my sister walked past the court, a rogue pass came flying directly towards her. My heart skipped a beat, and in that moment, Alice looked in the direction of the incoming ball. Just as it was about to hit, someone lunged, using their long arms to snatch the ball from the air, and fell sideways to Alice's feet as the crowd erupted in cheers.

Thank goodness! I watched as the person with the ball stood up and began speaking to her, only then realizing that it was the police officer she had been so concerned about. I didn't know what they were saying, but seeing her genuinely happy made me realize that she hadn't smiled since the night of the incident. Yes, she could have had a normal life if it weren't for me.

I stopped following Alice, I turned back towards home. Even though it wasn't my apartment, and despite it being temporary, it was already more of a home than that other place. I started searching for the address on the napkin, but I couldn't find it on the map app. As I began to realize that I didn't know what to do, Alice returned with the soy sauce.


## Chapter 10: The Next Intersection

**July 22, 6 PM.** The typhoon waning, the sky finally cleared.

Alice returned home to prepare dinner. Visualizing the ball hurtling towards her, she thought if it weren't for Peter, she would have been hit. In that whole moment, the two of them seemed so ordinary and normal, a young man and woman meeting on a summer evening. Now that the magic was over, and tomorrow she might have to face his more severe questioning as a police officer.

Xiao Ai barely heard Alice let out a quiet sigh and walked toward the kitchen.

"Big sister, let's go find Auntie Landlord," Xiao Ai said, hugging Alice who was cooking.

"Okay, let's go, but after dinner. By the way, her name is Jessica; she doesn't like being called Auntie," Alice replied, somewhat surprised by the change she noticed in Xiao Ai. But the thought of finding the landlord cast a heavy cloud of confusion over her heart. Hope for desperate people is like a poison.

**July 22, 7 PM.** The sunset was breathtakingly beautiful. They set out.

"How can this be?! The map app doesn't have an address for Unit 2301 at 282 Tanning Street?! This street doesn't even go up to number 100!"

"Maybe the map hasn't been updated? Let's go to that street and see if there's a tall building."

"That's a good idea. There aren't many tall apartment buildings in this small city. This street runs north to south, so let's start from the northern part of downtown and head south."

They initially thought it would be simple to track down the address, but the reality was more complicated, and time was running out! Alice and Xiao Ai put on their sneakers and jogged to the bus stop.

Twenty minutes later, they got off at their stop and started looking for a building with more than 23 floors along Tanning Street.

"Do you think that tall building across the street might be it?"

"But that looks like an office building, and if it has 23 floors, they're probably all offices."

**8 PM.** Fortunately it was summer, and the sun still lingered in the sky. But the two of them were gradually losing their energy in the heat and fading daylight. Alice watched Xiao Ai struggling to keep up and hesitated about whether to continue searching. Xiao Ai, showing surprising resilience, comforted Alice by saying, "Maybe we'll find the building at the next intersection!" Alice smiled, wiped her sweat, and said, "I didn't realize you had such stamina. I'm the one slowing us down."

**9 PM.** The city lights hummed as they began to light.

A young woman in her twenties and a little girl appeared, panting, in the lobby of a trendy apartment building in a busy area. The woman pressed the doorbell for the corresponding unit.

"Beep, beep, beep," but no one answered. Both of them showed tired and anxious expressions. "Alice, what do we do? This is the last apartment building with a Unit 2103. Was that fat auntie just messing with us?" the child said angrily. The young woman, catching her breath, didn't respond directly. Instead, she pressed the apartment doorbell again.

"Beep—hello, who's there?" A woman's unfamiliar voice answered; it wasn't the landlord.
