第零章：序曲（就是一个没头没尾的片断。接在片断七后面，然后跟着是片断八）
我推开小爱（现实生活中不认识的人）在我的小公寓里暂住的房间门，惊讶得看见她在收拾东西。房间里乱七八糟。她说她要搬走，不想连累我。我极力劝阻，因为知道她并无一个好去处。
她很倔强又冷静地看着我说：姐姐，我知道你不相信我。但是我不会告诉他们你有参与案件。因为，本来，那就全部都是我做的。
然后又低头把各纵东西放进被子里兜着，一边说：”我不想影响你的生活，影响那个警察哥哥和你。。。”
我打断她同样降低音量说：不要说傻话了。他接近我只是为了案子而已。我们俩现在还在一条船上。你不要这么着急走啊。你走又能走到哪里去？
我内心其实是绝望的，感觉再也回不去了，不可能骗自己什么也没有发生。但是依然勉强微笑着想留住她，好像我的生活已经结束，只剩下小爱了。
小爱却是坚持抱着被子就往门外走，走出门我们惊讶得发现，我的房东（同样是生活里不认识的人）竟然不知什么时候坐在了客厅沙发上。
Chapter Zero: Prelude (Just a fragmented scene. It follows Fragment Seven and is followed by Fragment Eight)
I pushed open the door to my small apartment, where Xiaoai (someone I didn't know in real life) had been staying temporarily for the past couple of days, only to be surprised to find her packing her things. The room was in disarray. She said she was leaving to avoid causing me any trouble. I strongly objected because I knew she had nowhere else to go.
She looked at me with determination and calmness, saying, "Sister (we are not siblings but in mandarin we use this as a common call even to strangers.), I know you may not believe me, but I won't tell them you were involved in the case. Because, originally, it was all me."
Then, she lowered her head to put her belongings into a sheet, all the while saying, "I don't want to disrupt your life, disrupt that police officer and you..."
I interrupted her in a hushed tone, saying, "Don't talk nonsense. He's only getting close to me because of the case. We two are still in this together. Please don't rush to leave. Where will you go?"
Deep down, I was desperate, feeling like I couldn't go back to a normal life anymore, I also unable to deceive myself that nothing had happened. But I still forced a smile to try and keep her, as if my life had already ended, leaving only Xiaoai.
However, Xiaoai persisted, clutching the sheet and heading for the door. When we stepped outside, we were shocked to discover that my landlord (another person I didn't know in real life, a completely imaginary character) was sitting on the living room couch, seemingly there at some point without us noticing.
第一章：自我介绍。
夏末，台风快要过去了，天气阴沉着下着小雨，有风微凉。离事发已经过了一天多了。
我和身边8岁的小爱往公寓走，我住的地方是一栋几十年楼年龄的赫鲁晓夫楼的最高层的最东边的一间。走到公寓楼下，虽然下过雨，那两个人的尸体轮廓线依然清晰。有三四个身着制服的人在公寓大门外活动，一个在打电话，一个在测量地上的痕迹。他们都没有打伞。看到这一幕身边的孩子靠过来紧贴在我的身侧，我轻轻搂住她的肩膀把伞向她倾斜。
我们走到公寓入口，收伞的时候故意挡住脸躲开他们的视线。正要赶紧闪进楼里的时候，有人喊住我们，回头看到是两个警察和一个社区保安。小爱拉住我的手又变紧了。保安向我打招呼说：“哎，小爱还辛苦你再照料几天，警方正在联系她的亲戚”。我摆出仔细斟酌过的表情，流露淡淡的悲悯伤感，再露出一点笑意，客气地说道“没什么，都是邻居，应该的。”
我注意到那两个警察中年轻的一个，十分的眼熟，好像在哪里见过。他看着我的眼神也好像若有所思的样子。我并不敢与他长久对视，就移开了视线。这时年轻警察想起来自我介绍了“你好，我叫PH，是公安局刑事课的警员。这位是我们的老刑警，冯警官。” 我也向他们自我介绍“你好，我叫L。是住小爱隔壁的邻居，这两天就先让她在我们家住着吧。” “住在离出事地旁边对这么小孩子真的好吗？她应该受了很大刺激吧。”我一下不知道该怎么回答，只好说道“平时她就经常来我这里玩，她挺粘我的。”
余光看见年纪大点的警察好像锐利地打量了我几眼，然后又去看小爱。我低头看见小爱低着头躲在我身后弱小依恋的样子。估计那个老警察也是看出她对我的依赖，我感觉投在我身上的视线好像温暖了几分。我心里其实惴惴不安，我的演技相比小爱实在是堪忧。幸好她机敏聪明还会洞察人心，不然我早就受不了这个压力了。一想到这孩子又是如何成为这样的性格，我又不禁心酸。
我们几个大人又寒暄了几句，我就带着小爱走进公寓楼。
Chapter One: self introduction
It was the end of summer, and the typhoon had almost passed. The weather was overcast with a light rain and a gentle breeze. It had been more than a day since the incident occurred.
I walked towards my apartment with Xiaoai, an 8-year-old girl by my side. My place was on the top floor, the easternmost unit of a decades-old Khrushchev-style building. Even though it had rained, the outlines of the two bodies on the ground were still visible. There were three or four people in uniforms outside the apartment entrance, one talking on the phone, and a few measuring the traces on the ground. None of them had umbrellas. Seeing this, the child beside me huddled closer to my side, and I gently put my arm around her shoulder, tilting the umbrella towards her.
As we approached the entrance of the apartment, I deliberately shielded my face as I closed the umbrella, avoiding their gaze. Just as I was about to hurry inside the building, someone called out to us. I turned around to see two police officers and a community security guard. Xiaoai gripped my hand even tighter. The security guard greeted me, saying, "Hey, thank you for taking care of Xiaoai yesterday. The police are contacting her relatives. Can she stay with you for another couple of days?" I put on a carefully considered expression, showing a hint of sadness and sympathy, and then smiled a little, politely saying, "It's nothing, we're neighbors; it's the least I can do for her."
I noticed that one of the two police officers, the younger one, seemed very familiar, like I had seen him somewhere before. His gaze at me appeared pensive as if he also recognized me for some reason. I didn't dare to hold his gaze for long and averted my eyes. At this moment, the young police officer introduced himself, "Hello, I'm PH, an officer from the Criminal Division of the Public Security Bureau. This is our veteran detective, Officer Feng." I also introduced myself, saying, "Hello, I'm L. I'm Xiaoai’s neighbor next door. She stays with me for now." The older police officer commented, "Is it really a good idea for her to stay next to the scene of the incident? She must be quite traumatized." I didn't know how to respond at once, so I just said, "She often comes over to my place to play; she's quite attached to me."
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the older police officer, seemingly scrutinizing me for a moment and then shifting his gaze to Xiaoai. I lowered my head and saw the little girl, who had lowered her head and was hiding behind me, looking fragile and dependent. I guessed that the old detective had also sensed her reliance on me, and I felt that the gaze directed at me had warmed up a bit. In reality, I was quite anxious; my acting skills were far from Xiaoai’s guise. Fortunately, she was smart and insightful, or else I wouldn't have been able to handle this pressure. Thinking about how this child had become this way, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness.
After exchanging a few more pleasantries with the police and security guy, Xiaoai and I finally entered the apartment building.
第二章：失踪的尸体（PH视角）
台风过境的那天是7.19。台风眼过境的时候警察局的同事接到了报警电话，说是在一个老居民楼下发现了两句尸体。我只能和一个同事尽快赶到现场，尽管我之前被台风困住好不容易趁着风雨停下刚刚赶回所里。去的路途还颇为不顺，第一轮的台风把那附近的供电系统破坏了，都没有路灯，终于经过规划凌乱的小区窄路开车到了那栋楼下。
一对中年男女的尸体被小区里的几个胆子大的人用手电筒远远照着。同事把现场围起来，我拍下尸体的样子画下了尸体的轮廓线。看起来是从楼上摔下来的，尸僵已经开始出现了，很可能已经死亡一个小时以上了，那差不多正是第一轮台风最猛烈的时候。还来不及完成这一切，台风眼的平静就结束了。狂风暴雨扑面而来，附近的电线杆摇摇欲坠，我们只好先退回楼里。用这个时间调查一下死者身份。
这老小区虽然破，但是位置好，所以现在居住的大部分都是各地来打工的人，没什么老居民了。大家彼此之间并不是很熟悉，我只好根据尸体的位置按楼层一家一家去询问。有些公寓没有人在，有些直说不认识。快到顶层的时候，问到了一家人，他们认出了死者，这就是他们楼上的一对夫妻。说是因为那家人非常吵闹，很影响他们休息，刚搬来的时候还交涉过，但也无济于事。楼上依然动不动有打架摔东西的声音。他们说这家似乎还有一个小女孩，并不太下楼和别的孩子一起玩，所以没怎么见过。
我们知道了这个关键的信息就赶紧冲上顶楼。这种老的赫鲁晓夫楼，很像motel，每一层住户共享一个走廊，走廊靠外一侧就是一米二左右高的外护栏靠里就是每一家的大门。顶楼也是漆黑一片，但在手电筒的光照下，我们要找的那户人家的大门正敞开着，大门还随着暴风雨晃动着。我和同事快步走进去，之间家里非常凌乱，也不知道是被人闯入还是平时就这样东西乱摆着。我们努力寻找那个小女孩，终于在她房间的角落看到了不省人事的孩子，我抱起她准备送去医院。就在这时，外面传来喧哗声，甚至盖过了风雨声。
尸体不见了。
Chapter 2: The Missing Bodies (PH's Perspective)
On the day the typhoon passed through, it was July 19th. While the eye of the typhoon was passing over, colleagues at the police station received a distress call, reporting the discovery of two bodies beneath an old residential building. Despite having been stranded by the typhoon earlier, I managed to return to the station just as the rain and wind subsided, then I hurried to the scene with a colleague. The journey there was quite challenging as the first round of the typhoon had damaged the power supply in the vicinity, leaving the streets without any streetlights. Eventually, we navigated through the chaotic layout of the neighborhood and reached the building.
The bodies laying there seem to be of a middle aged couple, illuminated by flashlights held by a few courageous residents from the community. My colleague secured the area, and I captured images of the bodies, outlining their positions. It appeared they had fallen from above, rigor mortis had already set in, indicating they had likely been deceased for over an hour, which coincided with the peak of the first round of the typhoon. Before we could complete our tasks, the calm of the typhoon's eye came to an end. Fierce winds and heavy rain returned, causing nearby power poles to sway dangerously. We had no choice but to retreat inside the building, using this time to investigate the identities of the deceased.
Although this old community was run-down, its location was desirable, which meant most residents were migrant workers from various places, and there weren't many long-term residents left. People didn't know each other very well, so I had to go door-to-door on each floor based on the location of the bodies to inquire. Some apartments were vacant, while others claimed not to recognize the victims. When we were nearing the top floor, we finally encountered a family who recognized the deceased as the couple living directly above them. They mentioned that this family was incredibly noisy and disrupted their sleep. They had even tried to negotiate when they first moved in, but it was futile. The upstairs neighbors continued to have frequent loud arguments and noisy disturbances. They mentioned that there seemed to be a young girl in that family, who rarely came downstairs to play with other children, so she wasn't well-known.
Armed with this critical information, we quickly ascended to the top floor. This old Khrushchyovka-style building resembled a motel, with each floor sharing a corridor. On one side of the corridor was an approximately 1.2-meter-high outer railing, and on the other side were the entrances to each apartment. The top floor was pitch black, but in the beam of our flashlights, we saw that the door of the family we were looking for was wide open, swaying with the storm. My colleague and I entered hastily, finding the interior in disarray, though we couldn't tell if it was due to a break-in or if it was always this cluttered. We frantically searched for the young girl and finally discovered her unconscious in a corner of her room. I picked her up, intending to take her to the hospital.
Just then, we heard commotion from outside, even louder than the raging storm.
The bodies had disappeared.
第三章 心动的感觉
7.20。一大早，警察就把楼底包围了。对楼里的居民以及小区的居民继续进行采访搜证。
PH问道：“冯警官，你看这个案子到底是怎么回事呢？”
冯刑警赞钉截铁地说：“谋杀”
PH点头：“尸体在我眼皮底下消失了，我很难不认同。可是这杀人动机是什么呢？那家人负债累累，不能是谋财害命。可能是高利贷债主来索命了？仇杀吧，凶手还算有良知，没有对孩子下手。但不管是什么动机，都安排出了跳楼的假象了，为啥还要偷走尸体呢？”
冯刑警沉思片刻，说道：”我现在确实猜不到凶手为什么杀人，但是如果是凶手把尸体偷走了，肯定是因为真正的犯罪手法中隐藏着关键的指向相关人士的信息。”
“嗯，却是，现在的重中之重是找到尸体。没有关键证据这个案子就算找到嫌疑人，也无法定罪。”
“那个孩子现在怎么样了，还是什么都不说吗？”
“那个孩子，好像受了很大的心理创伤，医生看了她身上的淤青，有些事旧的也有好几处是最近的。可能案发不久她就受伤昏迷了。我昨晚把她送去医院了，她现在应该还在医院。调查社会关系的小组还没有什么进展，没有找到她的其他亲属。目前就是她的一个邻居在医院照看她。”
“我要去见见这个孩子，目前也只有她和室内搜证这两个突破口了。”
“是的，”PH点点头回忆起昨晚被淋成落汤鸡的体验。“昨晚的暴风雨导致小区都断电了，他们又住顶楼，很可能是没有有效的目击者的。”
“等一下，你不是说那个邻居就住在他们旁边吗？她没有听见什么吗？”
“我昨晚就问了，人家都已经睡了，说什么也没有听见，被我敲门声强行吵醒了都不太清醒。不可能是她，她那么瘦，怎么可能在几分钟前处理了尸体，再跑上9楼回来睡得那么沉，还没有人看见。”
“唔。。你的敲门声比打雷还响吗？如果没有打雷响，那她应该没睡着才对，没睡着就有可能听到隔壁的动静吧。”
PH，第一次无法同意冯警官的思路，但他也无法说出全部的实话。他好像在哪里见过那个孩子还有邻居的姑娘，但是又想不起来。昨晚他敲开邻居姑娘的门的时候，看到开门的人的那一瞬间，他好像大脑空白了一下。
难道是心动的感觉吗？他摇摇头，赶紧把与工作无关的思绪赶走。

Chapter 3: The Feeling of Heartbeat
July 20th. 
Early in the morning, 9 hours after the bodies went missing, the police surrounded the building. They continued to inquire the residents in the building and the neighborhood.
PH asked, "Officer Feng, what do you think of this case?"
Detective Feng replied firmly, "Murder."
PH nodded, "The body disappeared right before my eyes, so I can't help but agree. But what could be the motive for this murder? The family was deeply in debt, so it doesn't seem like a financial motive. Could it be a loan shark or drug dealer? It seems like a vendetta, but the killer spared the child, thank god. Regardless of the motive, they staged a suicide by jumping from the building. So why steal the body?"
Detective Feng pondered for a moment and said, "I can't currently guess why the killer committed the murder, but if they stole the body, it's because the real method of the crime holds crucial information pointing to someone involved."
PH agreed, "You're right. Finding the body is our top priority now. Without key evidence, even if we find a suspect, we can't convict them."
"What about the child? Has she said anything yet?"
"That child seems to have suffered significant psychological trauma. The doctor found bruises on her body, some old, some recent. It's possible she was injured and unconscious shortly after the incident. I took her to the hospital last night, and she should still be there. The social relations investigation team hasn't made much progress, and we haven't located any other relatives. Currently, a neighbor is looking after her at the hospital."
"I want to meet this child. At the moment, she and the indoor crime scene are our two breakthrough points."
"Yes," PH nodded, recalling his experience of getting soaked in the rainstorm last night. "Last night's storm caused a power outage in the neighborhood, and since they live on the top floor, there likely weren't any reliable witnesses."
"Wait a minute, didn't you say that the neighbor lives right next to them? Didn't she hear anything?"
"I asked her last night, but she claimed to be asleep and said she didn't hear anything. I even woke her up with loud knocking on her door, but she wasn't fully awake. It couldn't have been her; she's so thin. How could she have dealt with a body just minutes ago, run up to the 9th floor, and then slept so soundly without anyone noticing?"
"Hmm... Was your knocking louder than thunder? If there was no thunder, she shouldn't have been sound asleep, and she might have heard noises from next door."
PH, for the first time, couldn't fully agree with Detective Feng's line of thinking, but he also couldn't reveal the whole truth. He felt like he had seen that child and the young lady next door somewhere before, but he couldn't recall it. When he opened the door next last night and saw the person who answered, his mind seemed to go blank.
Was it the feeling of attraction? He shook his head, quickly pushing away thoughts unrelated to work.
第四章 晚安
7.19号。
晚上发生的事情好像做梦一样，台风眼过去不久又开始狂风暴雨。站在门背后全身湿透的我，我的双手还在颤抖，头脑也无法思考任何问题了。脑海里都是不久前疯狂的画面，积水的走廊，风里撞击的门，闪电里看见的失去知觉的身体。。。。我强迫自己停下疯狂的思绪，去洗了一个热水澡躺在床上。
但说来奇怪，那么多冲击力极强的画面中，占据我心里最重要的部分的却是一个触感，是抱着同样湿透的小爱的时候她温热的头皮和发根的触感。在最初的冲动过后，我该害怕吗，后悔吗，该内疚吗。说什么也太晚了，警察随时都可能赶到。
我打开处方安眠药的时候，发现，我的药少了很多。明明上一周才领回来了一个月的药量，却只剩下不到三天的分量了。我苦笑，好吧，刚动了自杀的念头，药就没了。但至少今夜让我好好睡一觉吧。
晚安，小爱。你自由了。这样想着我昏睡了过去。
Chapter 4: Goodnight
7.19.
What happened felt like a dream. The eye of the typhoon had passed not long ago, and another fierce storm had begun. Standing behind the door, drenched from head to toe, my hands were still trembling, and I couldn't think of anything. My mind was filled with recent chaotic images - the flooded hallway, the pounding doors in the wind, the lifeless body glimpsed in the lightning. I forced myself to stop these frantic thoughts and took a hot shower before lying down on my bed.
Strangely, among all the intense scenes, what occupied the most important place in my heart was a sensation - the feeling of the warm scalp and roots of the hair of Xiaoai, who was equally soaked when I held her. After the initial impulse, should I be afraid, regretful, or guilty? It was too late for any of that; the police could arrive at any moment.
When I opened the prescription sleeping pills, I noticed that I had a lot less left. I had received a month's supply just last week, but now there were less than three days' worth. I sighed. Well, I had entertained thoughts of suicide just now, and the pills had disappeared. At least let me get a good night's sleep tonight.
Goodnight, Xiaoai. You're free now. With that thought, I drifted off into a deep sleep.
第五章 医院
小爱安静地躺在病床上，她一直是一个安静的孩子。这个安静是她学会的自我保护不被发现的能力。年轻的女孩坐在窗边抚摸着小女孩的头，和那晚一样是那么温热柔软的触感，只是是干爽的了。
摸着摸着，她在小爱头上摸到了一处已经愈合的疤痕，那里头发已经不再生长了。女孩脑中想到的是一些声音——
“你说谁没用！你再说一遍试试？臭婊子你也敢来训老子！”男人愤怒的声音混着醉意口齿不清地大骂，接着是椅子被猛地摔地上的声音，和女人的尖叫和疯狂叫骂连带着是很多东西被打翻了。咣，是一个酒瓶和一个硬物撞击的声音，哗啦啦是碎片飞溅的声音。
再细看小爱的脸颊，她又仿佛听到了另一些声音——
一声瓷器破碎的声音突然出现打断了打牌的吆喝声欢笑声。“小杂种，这都做不好，你怎么不去死。还敢瞪我！快滚。天天吃老子的喝老子的，一点都不知道感恩。”女人气急败坏地骂道，跟着一连串不堪入耳的辱骂。沉寂片刻，接着一个清脆的巴掌声。但是没有哭声，从来没有哭声传来。孩子已经知道哭泣是不会收获同情和温情的，只会让大人更加厌烦她。但她真的太累了，那个巴掌让她没有站稳，更多的碗被摔碎了。“不要吵了！赶紧收拾好，不要影响我们。” 是暴躁而洪亮的男人的声音，接着是快乐的“我们继续，刚是谁出的一对A？”
小爱胳膊上残留的淤青——
“说，钱是不是你偷的？谁给你的胆子，小小年纪就敢偷钱了？”男人大声吼道。“我没有，不是我！”孩子罕见地发声反抗了。“不是你还能是谁？”女人嘲讽的声音尖锐得令人恶心。啪，是皮带抽在皮肉上的声音。
女孩不忍心再数下去了。那两个人渣罪有应得。
小爱在半梦半醒中，感觉到了久违地温柔。是妈妈吗？可是前几天他们说妈妈已经病死了，一定是假的吧。我一直在等她来接我。可是如果她还活着，一定会来接我的吧。如果她还活着，她又在哪里呢？妈妈的音容已经逐渐模糊不清了，三年前，妈妈不堪忍受爸爸的酗酒赌博家暴，在一个夜里离开了再也没有回来。以前妈妈偶尔会打电话回来，如果响两声断开，就代表是妈妈。我就会打回去。妈妈也已经很久没有打过电话来。
过去几个月，现实中唯一的温暖只有那个邻居的大姐姐了。自从她搬过来，她会教我作业，带我去她打工的奶茶店玩，会帮我消毒伤口。可是她告诉我，她九月就要开学了会搬回学校住。唯一的希望也没有了。我好希望她能带我走。可是我自己的妈妈都没有来接我。
妈妈，不要走。
女孩擦去小爱眼角滑落的泪水，又一次陷入了更深的自责。为什么自己没能早一点救她呢？这样想着她的泪水也不住地往下落着。她站起来，背过身，压抑住哽咽的哭声，不想吵醒孩子。
她听到窗外有模糊地交谈声，磨砂玻璃上映出一个深色的挺拔的身影，和一个医生的白大褂。她觉得那个挺拔的身影有些眼熟又不敢出门看，只能透过磨砂的玻璃仔细去辨别。
等那个深色的身影走了之后，医生走了进来。小爱这时也醒了，医生查看了小爱的状况，说情况还好没有大碍。小爱坚持要跟女孩回家。女孩问医生在哪里补交费用。医生说，不用担心，刚刚有个男人已经专门来付过费用了，他本来也是想来看看小爱的，听说她在休息就先走了。
他是谁呢？女孩心里反复搜寻着那个身影。

Chapter 5: The Hospital

Xiaoai lay quietly on the hospital bed; she had always been a quiet child. This silence was a self-learned ability to protect herself from being noticed. A young woman sat by the window, gently stroking the little girl's head. It felt just as warm and soft as that night, but now it was dry.
As she touched her, the young woman felt a scar on Xiaoai's head, a place where hair no longer grew. In the girl's mind, a series of voices echoed:
"Who do you think you are? Say it again, I dare you! You worthless wretch! How dare you come here and lecture me!" The angry man's voice mixed with drunken slurs, followed by the sound of a chair crashing to the floor, a woman's screams, and furious curses, along with the crashing of many things. Bang! It was the sound of a bottle and a hard object colliding, followed by the shattering of glass.
Then, as she examined Xiaoai's cheek more closely, she seemed to hear more voices:
The sound of shattered porcelain suddenly interrupted the cheerful shouts and laughter from a card game. "You useless brat, can't even do this right! Why don't you just die? And you dare to glare at me! Get lost! You consume everything I have, and you don't appreciate it at all." The woman's voice was full of anger, followed by a series of unbearable insults. After a moment of silence, there was a crisp slap. But there was no crying; there was never any crying. The child had learned that crying would not bring sympathy or warmth from the adults; it would only make them angrier. But she was really tired, and that slap had made her lose her balance, causing more bowls to shatter. "Stop making noise! Clean up quickly, don't disturb us," the irritable and loud man's voice followed, then cheerful voices, "Let's continue, who played a pair of Aces just now?"
The bruises that remained on Xiaoai's arm:
"Tell me, did you steal the money? Who gave you the courage to steal money at such a young age?" The man shouted angrily. "I didn't, it wasn't me!" The child rarely voiced resistance. "If it wasn't you, then who could it be?" The woman's mocking voice was sharp and nauseating. Snap! It was the sound of a belt striking flesh.
The young woman couldn't bear to continue. Those two scoundrels deserved their fate.
In her half-awake state, Xiaoai felt a long-lost tenderness. Was it her mother? But they had said her mother had died of illness a few days ago; it must be a lie. She had been waiting for her to come and pick her up. But if her mother were alive, she would surely come for her, right? Where could her mother be? The image and voice of her mother had gradually become hazy. Three years ago, her mother had left one night, unable to endure her father's drinking, gambling, and abuse. She used to call occasionally, and if the call disconnected after two rings, it meant it was her mother. She would call back. But her mother hadn't called in a long time.
In the past few months, the only source of warmth in her life had been the older sister of their neighbor. Since she had moved in, she had taught her homework, taken her to the bubble tea shop where she worked, and helped her disinfect her wounds. But she had told her that she would be returning to school in September and moving back to the dorms. Even that last glimmer of hope was gone. She wished the older sister could take her away. But even her own mother hadn't come to pick her up.
Mother, please don't go.
The young woman wiped away the tears that had welled up in Xiaoai's eyes, once again drowning in deeper self-blame. Why couldn't she have saved her sooner? Thinking this, her tears continued to fall. She stood up, turned away, stifled her sobbing, and didn't want to wake the child.
Outside the window, she heard indistinct conversations and saw a dark figure against the frosted glass, accompanied by a doctor in a white coat. The tall, dark figure looked somewhat familiar, but she didn't dare go out to investigate; she could only carefully discern it through the frosted glass.
After the dark figure left, the doctor came in. At this point, Xiaoai was awake, and the doctor checked her condition, saying that she was doing okay and there were no major issues. Xiaoai insisted on going home with the young woman. The young woman asked the doctor where to pay the fees. The doctor replied not to worry, as a man had just come in and paid the bills specifically for Xiaoai. He had wanted to visit her but left when he heard she was resting.
Who could that man be? The young woman's mind was filled with thoughts of that shadowy figure.
第六章 懊悔
第二天醒来，我花了很久才清醒了一点。突然之间无数的头绪又一股脑涌上来。小爱在哪里，她还好吗？她是怎么做到的？对，是安眠药，一定是她拿去了。所以昨晚她才能够让她爸和继母不省人事吗？那我真的帮她杀人了。怎么办，要去自首吗？那我呢我去自首会被判多久呢。小爱才8岁，虽然不用负刑事责任，但小小年纪背负这种过去到底要怎么才能健康长大呢？当然如果那两人不死，小爱也是在地狱中活着而已。想到这里我只悔恨自己没有在一切发生前带她离开。如果我更强大更果断就好了。这些根本就不该由一个孩子来解决。我怎么能怪她呢？
我鼓起勇气下楼，发生了这种事，也不知道邻居们还有多少会继续住在这里。尸体已经不在了，剩下的只有警方画的轮廓。我避开所有人的好奇的目光照常走在去打工的奶茶店的路上。
