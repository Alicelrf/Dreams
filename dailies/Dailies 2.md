那是一百多年前，当纽约人想修建他们的第一条地铁的时候，当挖掘机第一次挖到那么深的地下，他们不知道惊醒了一只巨大的怪兽。那是一只巨大的蚯蚓怪兽，它活了好多好年，越长越大，它的洞也越挖越深，因为他也越来越孤僻。他无所事事，又缺乏维生素D，郁郁寡欢地缩在自己挖出的复杂地下宫殿中的一个角落。

突然有一天他的住宅被振得开始坍塌了，它大惊失色，在阳光照射进来之前躲进了更深的洞里。地铁的施工一天天按部就班地推进着。蚯蚓怪也搬家搬去了更深的地下，它时不时偷窥一下工作的工人和机器。终于有一天，它见到了它认识的最大的蚯蚓，都快比得上它了！那个新来的蚯蚓每天乐此不疲地以蚯蚓怪难以想象的速度钻着洞。蚯蚓怪震惊于这只新蚯蚓的移动速度，同时也诧异地发现，尽管它移动的很快，但它只在固定的一条线上冲来冲去。

这只新来的蚯蚓改变了蚯蚓怪无聊又平静的生活，它现在对这只奇怪的同类产生了强烈的好奇心。可是蚯蚓怪又是一个极度内向的怪物，即使那个新来的同类停了下来，它也不敢凑近去打招呼。（未完待续）

Over a century ago, when New Yorkers wanted to build their first subway, they didn't realize that their initial dig deep underground would awaken a giant monster. It was a colossal worm-like creature that had lived for many years, growing larger and burrowing deeper as it became more reclusive. Lacking vitamin D and idle, it sadly huddled in a corner of its complex underground palace.

One day, its dwelling began to collapse due to the vibrations, and it retreated into even deeper tunnels before the sunlight could reach it. Subway construction progressed methodically day by day. The worm monster moved to deeper grounds and occasionally spied on the working laborers and machines. One day, it encountered the largest earthworm it had ever seen, almost as big as itself! This new earthworm tirelessly burrowed holes at a speed unimaginable to the monster. The worm monster was amazed by the new earthworm’s speed and was also surprised to find that, despite its speed, it only moved back and forth along a fixed line.

This new earthworm changed the worm monster's dull and quiet life, sparking a strong curiosity in this strange kin. However, the worm monster was extremely introverted, and even when the new earthworm paused, it didn’t dare to approach and greet it. (To be continued)

十几年过去了，对于蚯蚓怪来说可能是十几天的时间而已，但另一种大蚯蚓在发生着剧烈的变化。首先，它们变得越来越多了，钻的也越来越快了，它们的领土越来越大，它们昼夜不歇地移动着。蚯蚓怪觉得这个邻居有点粗鲁，刚刚搬过来就搞出这么大的动静。

在1918年的秋天，蚯蚓怪正准备钻回更深的地里取暖，一声撞击声引起了它的注意。同时那些蚯蚓们似乎停下了移动。蚯蚓怪的好奇心促使它去声源地查看。啊，一条大蚯蚓似乎撞在了它的洞的墙壁上翻到在地了。它的身躯碎成了很多脆片，现场十分惨烈。

蚯蚓怪震惊地看着现场，它的好奇心战胜了它的社交恐惧症，问住在附近的老鼠们这是怎么回事。老鼠说，这些地铁逐渐老化了，设备维修员最近又在罢工，这次不知道怎么回事在这个弯道它没有减速，以5倍的速度通过，然后就脱轨了。

蚯蚓怪说，没想到，钻得太快还会出事啊。

然而，这件事并没有阻止在接下来的几十年里这些大蚯蚓越来越快了。蚯蚓怪不理解，明明发生了这么惨的事故，为什么非要钻得这么快呢。于是它试图时不时搞出一些小麻烦试图让它们慢下来。这也是为什么纽约地铁时不时就会故障晚点的原因啦！

Decades have passed, which might only seem like a few days to the earthworm monster, but another kind of giant earthworm was undergoing drastic changes. Firstly, their numbers were increasing, they were burrowing faster, and their territory was expanding; they moved relentlessly day and night. The earthworm monster felt that this neighbor was somewhat rude, making such a ruckus right after moving in.

In the autumn of 1918, as the earthworm monster was preparing to burrow deeper into the ground for warmth, a crashing sound caught its attention. At the same time, those earthworms seemed to have stopped moving. Driven by curiosity, the earthworm monster went to check the source of the noise. Ah, a giant earthworm seemed to have collided with the wall of its tunnel and flipped onto the ground. Its body broke into many brittle pieces; the scene was quite gruesome.

The earthworm monster, shocked by the scene, overcame its social anxiety and asked the nearby mice what had happened. The mice said that the subways were gradually aging and the maintenance crew had recently been on strike. This time, for some unknown reason, it didn't slow down at the curve, passing through at five times the speed, and then it derailed.

The earthworm monster remarked, "I didn't expect that burrowing too fast could also lead to accidents."

However, this incident did not stop the giant earthworms from speeding up even more over the following decades. The earthworm monster didn't understand why they insisted on burrowing so fast, especially after such a terrible accident. Thus, it tried to cause some minor disturbances from time to time to slow them down. This is also why the New York subway occasionally experiences malfunctions and delays!
