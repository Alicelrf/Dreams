我没有前世的记忆，真令人沮丧，做了好些唤醒前世记忆的催眠实验，结果只是睡得很香。尽管常常被好奇心驱使，去往人性的幽深探索，一无所获的我只想做微风里的一片小草。有时以为自己是被命运厚爱着的主角，有时又只能承认是个没有使命的匆匆路人。想要努力在生命的旅程里留下什么，又害怕着努力的结果被时间轻轻抹去。是不是还不如一开始就随风飘散，不留痕迹呢。

"I have no memories of past lives, which is quite frustrating. I've done many hypnosis experiments to awaken memories of past lives, only to end up sleeping deeply. Driven by curiosity, I often delve into the profound exploration of human nature, yet achieving nothing, I merely wish to be a blade of grass in the breeze. Sometimes I think I am the protagonist cherished by fate, at other times I must admit that I am just a passerby with no mission. I want to make an effort to leave something behind in the journey of life, yet I am afraid that the results of these efforts will be gently erased by time. Perhaps it would be better to just disperse with the wind from the start, leaving no trace."

今天我把公司电脑送到IT部门换新。IT部门在半地下室，很大面积的房间里目之所及都是堆在大桌子上的纸箱，电脑，电线。只有离门最远的窗户旁边有4张办公桌。一个高个子的男人注意到我便站起来看着我，我挥了挥手说明来意。

他问我有预约吗？我说没有，但我两周前就收到邮件和消息确认了我电脑的编号通知我把电脑送来，并且两周以来没有回答我关于时间或者预约的问题。

“那你知道那人叫什么吗？”

我说，”好像叫Dian….不好意思我想不起来了。Team里有，可是我现在登不上去了，因为我上周五改了密码，今天忘记了。可以顺便帮我重新设置一下吗？

那人手插口袋，微笑着不急不慢地说，你可以通过“service desk”修改密码，然后再和那个人联系完成预约再来。我们现在没有现成的设备给你。

我其实并不知道如何在无法登陆各种公司系统的情况下修改密码，但我猜这个部门只管硬件，所以只好再去问别人了。

就在我准备放弃时，一个梳着脏辫的看起来心情很好的男人说，“等一下，你的公司ID告诉我一下可以吗？” 

他在系统里搜索了我给的信息，然后对同事说，“啊，她这个电脑确实随时都可以来换了呢。”然后他接过我的电脑和dock，问我文件都备份了没有。我说我现在登录不上去，于是他就通过管理员的权限进入service desk让我重置了密码。我顺利地登陆了就电脑，完成了备份。

接下来他把新电脑和就电脑都拿到了一条细长的吧台上。台面上用黄色和红色的胶带分隔出大约80厘米的间隔，这样每个间隔都大约是个80厘米。

他一边重新安装着系统，一边解释说“旧电脑的操作系统版本太旧了，不能支持新版Teams了。”我略不解地问道“可是我每次都完成了它需要的更新啊。”脏辫同事的声音和善又快活，笑着解释说“你们完成的都是小的补丁，大的版本更新都需要我们来做。我现在在安装这些软件，其余的你可以自己去公司软件平台安装。大概还要20分钟。”

在密码重置好之后，其实我就很放松了，他还帮我重新设置好了手机上的Authenticator。无所事事的我就在房间里转悠了起来。

我突然发现白板上整齐地写满了名字，本来以为是这里的工作人员的名字，试图去找当时联系我的人，却在无意中看到了自己的名字。我惊喜地问脏辫同事“嘿，我的名字在这里哎。”他抬起头笑着说，“是的，名字在上面的其实都是可以随时来换电脑了。”

我又绕回他站着工作的吧台，指着那些胶带问道“这些分区是像急救分区一样吗？病得比较严重的电脑放在红色的区域，不太麻烦的放在黄色？”

他笑得更开心了“确实像你说的那样分会更合理整洁一些，但我们现在没有这样区分。其实也没有严格按照格子放。但那确实是个好主意呢！”

最后他完成了所有的更新“That’s everything. You are ready to go! My name is Justin. I will keep your old laptop for three days before wiping it out. So if you have missed anything from backup or run into any problems, you can send me messages on teams. ”

我向他道谢并离开了。

I said “Thank you Justin! You saved me a lot of time today!”


"Today, I brought my company laptop to the IT department for a replacement. The IT department is located in a large room in the half-basement, filled with cardboard boxes, computers, and wires all over the big tables. Only four desks were near the window farthest from the door. A tall man noticed me and stood up, looking at me as I waved to explain my purpose. He asked if I had an appointment. I said no, but I had received an email and a message two weeks ago confirming the number of my computer and instructing me to bring it in, and for two weeks, there had been no answer to my questions about the time or appointment. 'Do you know the name of the person?' he asked. I replied, 'It seems like Dian... sorry, I can't remember. It's in the team, but I can't log in now because I changed my password last Friday and forgot it today. Can you help me reset it?' The man, with his hands in his pockets and a smile, said slowly, 'You can change your password through the 'service desk', then contact that person to complete the appointment before coming here. We don't have a ready device for you now.' I actually didn't know how to change the password when I couldn't log into various company systems, but I guessed this department only handles hardware, so I had to ask someone else.

Just when I was about to give up, a man with dreadlocks, looking in a good mood, said, 'Wait a minute, can you tell me your company ID?' He searched the system with the information I gave, and then told his colleague, 'Ah, her computer is indeed ready to be changed at any time.' He then took my laptop and dock, asking if I had backed up my files. I said I couldn't log in, so he logged into the service desk with admin rights and let me reset my password. I logged in successfully, backed up my files, and he then took both my new and old computers to a long bar. The counter was divided by yellow and red tape into intervals of about 80 cm each.

While reinstalling the system, he explained, 'The old computer's operating system version is too old to support the new version of Teams.' I asked, puzzled, 'But I always completed the required updates.' The dreadlocks colleague, cheerful and friendly, explained with a laugh, 'What you completed were minor patches; major version updates need to be done by us. I am now installing these programs, and you can install the rest yourself from the company's software platform. It will take about 20 more minutes.'

After the password was reset, I was actually quite relaxed, and he also helped me reset the Authenticator on my phone. With nothing to do, I wandered around the room. I suddenly noticed that the whiteboard was neatly filled with names. I originally thought they were the names of the staff here and tried to find the person who had contacted me, but accidentally saw my own name. Surprised, I asked the dreadlocks colleague, 'Hey, my name is up here.' He looked up and said with a smile, 'Yes, the names up there are actually those who can come to change their computers at any time.'

I circled back to where he was standing at the bar, pointing at the tape and asked, 'Are these divisions like emergency zones? Seriously sick computers in the red area, less troublesome ones in yellow?' He laughed even more, 'Indeed, dividing them as you described would be more reasonable and tidy, but we don't differentiate like that now. Actually, we don't strictly place them according to the squares. But that's indeed a good idea!'

Finally, he completed all the updates, 'That’s everything. You are ready to go! My name is Justin. I will keep your old laptop for three days before wiping it out. So if you have missed anything from backup or run into any problems, you can send me messages on Teams.' I thanked him and left. I said, 'Thank you, Justin! You saved me a lot of time today!'"

自我分析是一件危险的事情，因为所有关于自我的断言都有可能变成预言。而所有模棱两可的或者错误结论都有可能变成下一次的困惑。有时我会因为做了过多的自我反思掉进了无法证明亦无法证伪，自相矛盾又自圆其说的境地。当然，或许这比简单的结论更接近真相。

关于竞争：我想要竞争吗？我善于竞争吗？我喜欢竞争吗？我会因为害怕输而回避竞争吗？

我想要竞争吗？在我发现我比较可能会赢的时候，我会想要竞争。在我被激怒被挑衅的时候我会想要赢。而且从小学起我就是容易被激将的孩子。

我善于竞争吗？在我全心全意想要赢，觉得非赢不可的时候，我确实非常专注，确保没有低级的失误。并且在我进入这个模式之后，我鲜又失败。

我喜欢竞争吗？我好像无法确定我是否喜欢竞争。如果竞争是我主动参加的，我可能会喜欢，心态会轻松一些。如果是被动参加的（被挑衅），我会非常想要赢。但与此同时，我非常讨厌被动参加竞争的那种焦虑和压力。觉得如果被挑衅了然后在竞争中输掉会让自尊心大受打击。

同时我察觉到近些年我可能会因为害怕输而回避竞争。在不重要的竞争中，当我看不到明显的赢面的时候，我即使参与了竞争，但是心态不是非赢不可的状态，也不会那么专注。

关于期望

我希望父母对我有高于大部分人的期望吗？

我觉得这样的期望一方面是对于我的能力和潜力的认可，但另一方面类似挑衅，我觉得我被迫进入竞争并且无法接受自己输掉。我好像无法控制自己在被挑衅之后的心态，我非常讨厌那种身不由己的感觉。因为如此，我很讨厌父母的期望，另一方面不由自主想要去实现它。我感觉父母擅自表达的很多期待没有尊重我的原始动力，我原始的自我期待。他们经常认为我没有足够努力，如果努力了会有更多结果。

但是因为我日常处在注意力分散，喜爱玩乐的状态，以及我有自己特殊的学习方式：潜意识学习甚至睡觉学习，让我看起来没有在努力。同时我无法掌控也无法预判自己的学习能力。我只能在压力和失控中期待自己能够实现目标满足期待。同时父母只会看到，我心情沉重了一些（因为压力变大并且结果不可控），他们以为是我减少了娱乐时间去努力学习，认为是我的努力有了效果。但这与其说是我主动努力的效果，不如说是被动竞争的压力，或多或少得让我的注意力向那个方向转移，然后一个偶然的结果。我时常努力向他们说明，这真的不是努力的结果，只是偶然，但是他们依然觉得我不够努力还有提高空间。我能怎么办呢？我当时甚至现在对于自己的思维是如何运作的毫无概念，解决问题总是依赖灵光一闪。我即使成功依赖了自己的灵感一千次，我也不知道下一次它会不会成功。我思维跳跃，青春期时非常缺乏学习的方法和科学的思维方式作为补充。所依赖的只有自己的黑箱大脑。非常没有安全感。我当时甚至希望自己和同学们一样，可以按部就班地提高成绩，用努力和时间扎实地学习。这样我就可以有理由管理他们的期待了。

关于天赋和努力

我希望被看作是有天赋的吗？

我希望被看作是有天赋的，聪明的孩子。可能因为中国的教育总是攀比的，资源倾斜向有天赋的孩子。如果被认为没有天赋，会失去关注失去很多成长的机会。所以即使装也要装作有天赋的样子。但是，被视为有天赋会因此背上更多的期待。但更多的期待对于我来说是更多的压力，并且我没有确切途径去实现它吗。所以我也学会了一些技巧假装在努力并且声称自己尽力了。但内心深处我很困惑，到底哪里是我这个黑箱大脑的极限。同时我也害怕真的知道那个极限在哪。


在我8岁以前，对于数学我从来没有灵光一闪过。我毫无抽象能力。我爸曾经非常焦虑，拿我和小区里一个被收养的同龄孤儿对比，说他比我聪明。每天上学放学路上被他一直提问简单的加减法，我却答不上来只能乱猜，非常窘迫痛苦。他的失望和焦虑深深影响了我。

我听说很多人一辈子也没有开窍并且害怕数学。万幸的是，后来我有了至少高于平均值的抽象能力。我对于开窍的瞬间毫无记忆。那份开窍前对于自己落后了，可能要永远让他们失望下去的焦虑好像一直伴随着我。我遇到的每一个问题，在我的黑箱跳跃地找到解决思路之前，我都处在一种不知道这一次能不能想出来的带着焦虑的不确定中。

我不容易控制自己的注意力，不容易让自己去做事情，不容易控制自己的情绪，不容易控制自己不受他人影响，还搞不清楚自己是如何知道答案的，不知道这种不可控的思维方式到底能让我走多远。

Self-analysis is a dangerous endeavor, as all assertions about oneself could become prophecies. Ambiguous or incorrect conclusions may lead to further confusion. Sometimes, excessive introspection leads me into a contradictory and self-validating predicament that cannot be proven or disproven. Perhaps, this comes closer to the truth than simple conclusions.

Regarding competition: Do I want to compete? Am I good at competing? Do I enjoy competition? Do I avoid competition for fear of losing?
I feel like competing when I see a good chance of winning or when provoked. I've been easily provoked since elementary school.
Am I good at competing? When I'm fully committed to winning, I'm very focused and ensure there are no basic mistakes. Once in this mode, I seldom fail.
Do I enjoy competition? I'm not sure if I enjoy it. I might enjoy it if I initiate it, feeling more relaxed. If it's forced (provoked), I really want to win but hate the anxiety and pressure of such situations. Losing in such circumstances would be a blow to my self-esteem.
I've noticed in recent years that I might avoid competition out of fear of losing. In trivial competitions where I don't see a clear advantage, even if I participate, my mindset isn't fixated on winning, and I'm less focused.

About expectations: 
Do I want my parents to have higher expectations of me than most?
I feel that such expectations acknowledge my abilities and potential but also feel like a challenge. I hate the feeling of being forced into competition and losing. I despise that I cannot control my reaction after being challenged. Thus, I loathe the expectations from my parents but involuntarily strive to meet them. They often think I'm not trying hard enough and could achieve more if I did.
Due to my distracted and playful nature, and my unique learning methods (subconscious or sleep learning), it appears I don't make an effort. I can't control or predict my learning abilities and can only hope to meet expectations amidst pressure and chaos. My parents only see that I am less cheerful (due to increased pressure and uncertain outcomes) and think I'm reducing leisure to study hard. They believe it's the result of my efforts, but it's more about the forced focus from competition pressure, leading to coincidental results. I always try to explain to them that it's not due to effort but coincidence, yet they still see room for improvement. What can I do? I have no idea how my mind works or how to solve problems other than relying on sudden insights. Even if I succeed a thousand times with my insights, I don't know if it will work the next time. My thinking is erratic, and during adolescence, I lacked methodological learning and scientific thinking to complement my 'black box' brain. I wished I could study systematically like my peers to manage their expectations.

About talent and effort: 
Do I want to be seen as talented?
I want to be seen as talented and smart, especially since in China, educational resources are skewed towards the talented. Being seen as untalented means losing opportunities for growth. I've learned tricks to pretend to be trying and claim I did my best. Deep down, I'm confused about the limits of my unpredictable mind and scared to find out its limits.

Before I was eight, I never had any 'eureka' moments with mathematics and lacked abstract thinking skills. My dad, anxious and disappointed, would compare me unfavorably with a neighborhood orphan, heightening my embarrassment and pain. His disappointment deeply affected me.
I've heard many people never have their moment of clarity with math and fear it. Fortunately, I developed above-average abstract skills eventually, with no recollection of that turning point. The pre-enlightenment anxiety of continually disappointing others seems ever-present. Each problem I face leaves me anxious and uncertain before I find a solution in my unpredictable mind.
Controlling my attention, actions, emotions, and influences from others is challenging, and I'm unclear on how I come to know answers, unsure how far this uncontrollable way of thinking can take me.

春天来了，空气中多了很多东西。有水蒸气，有花粉，有蒲公英的绒毛，有蜂蜜色的阳光。所有生命都如花车游行一般欢乐地向着夏天进军。在和煦的风里，树枝上长出了茸茸的拳曲的嫩叶，那个诱人的新生的色泽令人泫然。突然之间时间就变得不够用了，在冬天里，太阳懒懒的我也懒懒的。好像不做什么也没有关系，原本就是修生养息的时候。很多事情都被一句“等春天来了再说吧”打发了。现在春天到底是来了，然而时间哪够呢，要赏花要观鸟要除草要晒太阳要大扫除要踏青要打网球要野餐要做白日梦。这春天过于美好，浪费和珍惜是同一件事情。

窄窄的过道，充分利用的空间，精巧的设计，均匀的噪音， 平稳的加减速——火车旅行有一种非常令人安心的氛围。独行的旅行者躲在来往的陌生人中在角落里时而阅读时而偷听时而打盹儿，希望旅途不要到达终点。窗外的景色无论好坏都是恰到好处。壮观或者优美的风景固然令人赞叹，平凡的乡间风景可以让人放心合眼养神不必叹息无法拍照不必担心错过什么，再睁开眼也还是那样宁静又普通。

Spring has arrived, bringing a multitude of elements to the air. There's water vapor, pollen, dandelion fluff, and honey-colored sunlight. All life joyously parades toward summer like a floral procession. In the gentle breeze, fuzzy, curled young leaves sprout on branches, their inviting new color deeply moving. Suddenly, there seems to be not enough time; in winter, when the sun and I were both lazy, it seemed okay to do nothing, as it was a time for recuperation. Many things were postponed with a "Let's wait until spring." Now that spring is truly here, however, where is the time? There's so much to do: admire flowers, watch birds, weed, sunbathe, do spring cleaning, go hiking, play tennis, picnic, daydream. This spring is too wonderful; wasting it and cherishing it are the same thing.

The narrow aisle, efficiently utilized space, exquisite design, consistent noise, smooth acceleration and deceleration—train travel has a very reassuring atmosphere. A lone traveler, hidden among passing strangers, steals moments in the corner to read, eavesdrop, or doze, hoping the journey never reaches its destination. The scenery outside the window, whether spectacular or plain, is just right. While stunning or beautiful views are admirable, ordinary rural landscapes allow one to rest assured, close their eyes to rejuvenate without sighing over the inability to take photos or worrying about missing anything, knowing that upon opening their eyes, the scene will still be tranquil and ordinary.

以下是一些关于novel的构思，vitrus 的幻象身份和Alice的关系发展大致是：

Alice昏迷中，virus构建了一个世界让她混乱无法分辨现实和幻觉。它构建的世界里，他们是在VR游戏里结识，分离，又偶遇了几次，最后成为同伴好友，也认识了共同的朋友。（Alice从梦境中“醒来”以为就是现实，但其实还在幻境之中，就无法立刻意识到还有被她遗忘的来自真正的现实的回忆，还有人在等她醒来。）在那个幻境中，战争开始了，他们一同战斗，战斗后期virus揭露身份，virus和Alice达成协议。

从“僵尸high five”的游戏开始认识，然后分离（Virus是魔法师）

在“吃鱼的小妖”的游戏再次相遇, 然后分离 (Virus是皇帝） 

在“flatland”的大制作游戏里认识了另一个姑娘R的人格，她保护Alice并警告她不要相信这个世界里的人。

接下来Alice独自玩了一个bugland的游戏，开始觉得孤独迷失了。

Alice以为自己玩了一个非常真实的游戏（就是城市里无人驾驶车全部被诱导着上了一艘船的那个梦），他们车上的4个人(virus是其中一人，R是另一人)一同经历了惊险。Alice以为这也是一个VR游戏的时候，发现这次其实是在那个世界里发生的真事，不是游戏。

Alice开始探索幻境世界，她现在逐渐会辨别自己一觉醒来是在幻境世界还是在游戏里，但还是偶尔会搞错。她在环境中认识的伙伴们有时还会因此恶作剧尤其是virus。（游戏里可以有魔法，但幻境世界里看起来只是科技发达。）这些经历中Alice 逐渐对幽默又神秘的virus人格产生了信赖，但是更信赖的R好像一直对virus抱有敌意。

战争开始了，逐渐有好多Alice的朋友伤亡。（战争其实是现实里的医疗手段，想要清除病毒，唤醒病人的意识，所以virus造出来的幻觉人物会逐一消亡）。

Here are some ideas about the novel, with Virus's phantom identity and Alice's relationship development outlined as follows:
While Alice is in a coma, Virus constructs a world that confuses her, making it difficult to distinguish between reality and illusions. In this constructed world, they meet, separate, and encounter each other several times in a VR game, eventually becoming companions and friends, and meeting mutual friends. (Alice "wakes up" from the dream thinking it is reality, but she is still in the illusionary world and can't immediately realize that there are memories from the real reality that she has forgotten, and people are waiting for her to wake up.) In this illusionary world, a war starts, and they fight together. In the later stages of the battle, Virus reveals his identity, and he and Alice reach an agreement.
They first meet during the "Zombie High Five" game, then separate (Virus is a magician),
They meet again in the game "The Little Monster that Eats Fish," then separate again (Virus is the emperor).
In the major production game "Flatland," they meet another girl, R, who has a personality that protects Alice and warns her not to trust the people in this world.
Next, Alice plays a game called "Bugland" alone and starts to feel lonely and lost.
Alice thinks she played a very realistic game (the dream where all the driverless cars in the city were lured onto a ship), where she and four people in the car (including Virus and R) experienced dangers together. When Alice thinks this was also a VR game, she realizes that this time it actually happened in that world and wasn't just a game.
Alice begins to explore the illusionary world, gradually being able to distinguish whether she's waking up in the illusionary world or in a game, but she still occasionally makes mistakes. Her companions in the environment, especially Virus, sometimes play pranks on her. (Magic is possible in the game, but the illusionary world seems to be just technologically advanced.) Through these experiences, Alice gradually develops trust in the humorous and mysterious personality of Virus, but R, who she trusts more, seems to always harbor hostility towards Virus.
The war starts, and gradually many of Alice's friends are injured or killed. (The war is actually a medical procedure in reality, aiming to eliminate the virus and awaken the patient's consciousness, so the illusionary characters created by Virus gradually disappear).

虽然virus很强大，能把宿主原本的记忆暂时屏蔽掉，代替以幻觉然后让宿主沉浸在幻觉中昏迷不醒。大概是由于Alice超凡的创造力和想象力，Alice 在昏迷中不完全是被virus的幻境控制的。因为在virus自己的幻境中除了virus创造出来的角色，Alice自己也在不停的创造角色，同时还有以Peter女友C的人格为基础的人物R提醒Alice不要信任任何人。

为什么会在幻境中增加一层VR游戏呢？这也是因为virus发现Alice这个宿主不容易被控制被说服，如果只有一层幻境，被识破了就结束了。如果在幻境世界中引入了VR游戏，这更深一层的沉浸式体验，在回归幻境的时候，Alice更容易相信幻境就是现实。

"Although the virus is powerful enough to temporarily block the host's original memories and replace them with hallucinations, causing the host to be immersed in them and remain unconscious, it seems that due to Alice's extraordinary creativity and imagination, Alice is not completely controlled by the virus's illusions while she is unconscious. In the illusionary world created by the virus, apart from the characters created by the virus, Alice herself keeps creating characters. Additionally, a character based on the personality of Peter's girlfriend C, named R, reminds Alice not to trust anyone.

Why add a layer of VR game in the illusionary world? This is also because the virus found that the host, Alice, is not easily controlled or persuaded. If there is only one layer of illusion, once it is seen through, it ends. By introducing a VR game into the illusionary world, this deeper immersive experience makes it easier for Alice to believe that the illusion is reality when she returns to it."
