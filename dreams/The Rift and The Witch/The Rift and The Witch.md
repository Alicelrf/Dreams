# The Rift and The Witch

The other dream started from a multi-culture event market with many tents!
People are having fun in the events, there are so many tents with many interesting people selling stuff or performing.
I saw a girl went into a pretty tent and didn’t walk out for a while. I decided to have a look to see if there is anything interesting!
It was a witch dressed woman selling witches’ stuff like crystal balls, strange rings etc.
And she is giving the girl a one-time tattoo
She just used a special paint to paint on the girls arm
And she was doing some spells to make the tattoo look more mysterious and powerful…
She said it would protect her from harms
I asked her how much it was. And she said it’s 10 dollars for one temporary tattoo.
So I also sit down and asked for a temporary tattoo.
I paid her with cash when it’s done. I didn’t have any changes, so I had to give her a 100 bill. She was talking to me about how I should take care of the tattoo while giving my changes back.
I took back the change and I almost didn’t pay attention to how much she gave me. But one of the bills she gave me was ridiculous it was definitely not real money. And the total amount was not correct either. So I was annoyed and asked for my proper amount of changes.
I can tell from her reaction that she did it on purpose and was hoping she was not caught by me.
She shrugged and reluctantly gave me back my changes. And I walked out telling the next one to watch out.
Then she got pissed off and chase after me out of her tent and yelled something I couldn’t distinguish.
I was trying to enjoy myself the rest of the event hanging out with Troy. The unpleasant experience was still hanging around my mind while I was trying to ignore it. After all I got my money back and a new cool tattoo.
However, soon I found suspicious people tailing us. And with the tattoo I could do Disapparate and apparate, like Harry Potter.
The problem is whenever I got to the new place tails will pop up soon also like the days when Harry and Hermione were chased by death eaters
And things got worse and worse. I can’t dissapparate as time pass by but the tails are getting long and long.
Troy and I tried to get on a train which was about to leave the platform so that we can get off them.
We rushed to the platform from the hall of the train station.
Like this movie
There was this automatic glassdoor at the entrance of the platform
And the moment Troy and I step across the glass door, he disappeared and the people chasing us also disappeared
And there was a woman’s voice from the sky saying she is the god I was calling to save me.
But the voice sound familiar: it was no god but the witch from the tent!
I asked her what she wanted! And she said now Troy and I were separated into two worlds. There was some big differences just happened. In my world Trump got elected and in his world Hillary got elected.
And this two world will be super different in a couple of years because in the world Hillary was elected there will be some big progress in nuclear fusion power generation. But it won’t happen in the world where Trump was electedz
Because all the fundings for stem was cut by a lot
And some of the less promising projects will be cut off
What Troy and I need to do in order to see each other again is: he will try to slow down the tech development of that world and I will need to push harder on my side.
So, in four years, if the two worlds are not too different, we will be able to see each other again at the moment when the main torch got lighted on the Tokyo Olympic opening ceremony.
“Okok I get it. Bbbut can you at least switch us two? His major is physics I am sure he can do better in this world to help with the project. At least better than me! “ the voice paused and agreed
The voiced disappeared for a couple of minutes. Then she came back with some news “well I asked your boy friend about your proposal. However, he said he doesn’t want to live in a world led by person like Trump. So, sorry, you are by yourself honey. Bye bye”
I was so pissed that I woke up from the dream completely
I skipped some part of the dream. I did enjoy the magic temporarily
It allowed me to cook the same food with different effects on people’s mood at will.
Anyway the witch was mad at me and gave me some curse on top of the original magic with the tatoo
