# House Robot

I dreamt last night that in the future, everyone lives in modular homes that can easily be dismantled into rectangular rooms. (It seems you can even buy houses directly on Amazon in the U.S. now!) In some popular tourist villa areas with ocean and lake views, people would move their homes there. However, each family is only allowed to stay there for a certain period, such as a year. When the time is up, they have to move away with their house, leaving the land for others to live on.
I dreamt of a giant metal structure robot, hundreds of meters tall. In the dream, everyone received a submarine earthquake warning, and a tsunami was coming. The robot helped everyone move quickly, with its body hung from bottom to top with rectangular little houses. Then, it took big strides over mountains and rivers to move everyone to the inland and highlands. Upon arrival, it took down everyone's houses and placed them in a safe place. Then, it sat down to rest against a small mountain in the sunset.
