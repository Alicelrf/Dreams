# Prelude

A young Penguin, quiet and curious, studied the world. What he saw he understood. What he understood, he learned.

Our young Penguin had friends. Some good and some bad. The parents of his friends often found themselves talking to him, and sometimes learning from him. He was a smart little penguin. He seemed to know much, and without the need to learn it.

Our young Penguin was shy, and often hid himself if he could. He liked the quiet, the calm, and many penguins his age were loud. But this made him stand out from the crowd.

Other penguins latched on to him because he seemed different. They were quite mean to him. Our young little Penguin didn't understand why penguins could be so mean or cruel. He learned to observe, and to feel when they were near or when they were dangerous, and what paths he could take and things he could do to avoid them. Our little Penguin learned to see. 

One penguin, V, was particularly smart and especially bad, and knew that the teachers wouldn't stop him if all he did was talk. He called our young Penguin names, and made fun of him whenever he could. He knew that it hurt, and could see it in the young Penguins eyes.

Our young Penguin decided to close off his heart and mind, and decided not to trust other penguins anymore. He decided not to feel, and to numb himself from what that penguin said to him. He built up armour, and filled in all it's cracks, until the world couldn't touch him. Until other penguins couldn't touch him. Until even he could not touch his own soul. Our young Penguin closed himself off to all the world and to himself. He worked hard to be safe from all harm.

Eventually the words of V got to him, slowly seeping into his mind. Our young Penguin started to believe the things V told him. He started to believe that he wasn't special, smart, strong, or brave. The armour he built, and his keen eyes couldn't save him in the end.

This was how life was for a long time.

# Chapter 1

Our young Penguin's father called out to him.

"Son, your grandfather has died."

His father couldn't speak, and our young Penguin couldn't either. He walked home alone to his family, leaving everything behind.

Many penguins gathered to say goodbye to his grandfather. Many penguins were here that he had never met before, and had never heard of. As he spoke to them, he learned that his grandfather had taken good care of all of them. He learned that all of these penguins owed much to his grandfather, and were here to thank him.

Our young Penguin decided on that day that he would be like his grandfather. That he would try to live a life like he had lived.

Our young Penguind decided to be a father to those that needed it around him, like his grandfather had.

He said, "I will be Penguin Dad".

# Chapter 2

Penguin Dad took care of the other students at his university. He taught them many things. All of the penguins liked him because he was always patient and calm.

One penguin he met was Argentenian. This Argentenian Penguin was special. She immediately saw through his armour, through his calm serenity. She saw that he was not ok, that his soul was deeply wounded from 100,000 cuts.

They fell deeply in love, but it was not always easy. The Argentenian Penguin was also hurt, and Penguin Dad saw through her too. She was full of light, full of life, but she was using it to bury her wounds, like Penguin Dad was using his armour. 

Often, they would hurt eachother in their own way, because although they loved eachother, they did not love themselves. Penguin Dad did not believe that he was worthy of the love of anyone, and so he often questioned and tested the love of the Argentenian Penguin. And the Argentenian Penguin could not allow herself to love because she did not trust the love of others, she had been hurt too badly and believed something was broken and damaged inside her, too broken to be loved. She could not fully trust another until she learned to feel real love for herself first.

The Argentenian Penguin said she would let Penguin Dad hear about her story, if Penguin Dad agreed to get some help of his own. So Penguin Dad set out to find a therapist so he could heal. While he did, the Argentenian Penguin told him her story. How she had been abused so many times, and by her own family member.

Penguin Dad gently held her heart, and her soul. He absorbed all her hurt, and all her words, always telling her he loved her no matter what. Telling her he would love her until the end of days. Telling her that she was safe, and that he would never hurt her. He helped her understand what happened to her, and that she didn't need to be scared. Even in the face of her anxiety, her fear, and her anger, Penguin Dad's gentle love held strong. In time the warmth, calm, and safety of Penguin Dad's love let her heal. Finally trusting herself, and trusting another's love, she had the strength to set out and find the love of her life. She left Penguin Dad to find her great love.

Although Penguin Dad was sad to see her go, he cried great happy tears when he learned why she left. Penguin Dad never stopped loving her, and his love keeps her heart warm to this day.
