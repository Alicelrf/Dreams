# The Black Panthers

I dreamed that I became a trusted comrade in Black Panther in very early stage. (I don't know much about the real BP in history but in my dream they are a group of honourable people want to build their own community better and get more resources/influence as a community).

Because I was a tutor (some math some physics some literature) for the kids whose parents are core members.

I tried to cover them from the police, I was with them when tax investigators try to get into they basement to spy.

I was helping them with ideas to better budget and tax reduction.

They were really nice to me and the kids are cute.

The most intense part was to look at one of the parents of my students got arrestend on the street. And I had to behave like I didn't know that guy, and I was not involved at all. Their kids were right beside me, and they are so smart and strong. They got my hint to pretend they didn't know the arrested guys.

The community were also trying to build a little chicken farm under the radar. I help them by claiming those are for the biology lab for educational purposes lol.

The kids and their parents picked many good books as gifts for me. They have really good taste! And I put them into our library.
