# Alice in Flatland

In a European medieval-style restaurant, several people were eating nervously, and no one was speaking.

As they ate, an alarm resembling a train whistle sounded outside. Everyone put down their utensils and anxiously sought shelter.

I didn't understand what was happening. I saw a plump woman crawl into the beige linen embroidered curtain tucked away in the corner. The curtain didn't reach the floor, exposing her plump legs and slender high heels. Her round body shape was also vaguely visible. I heard a man make a slight disdainful sound, then quickly crawled under the table. Others were hiding behind cupboards, but their hiding places didn't seem particularly clever. Everyone seemed panicked yet resigned to hiding.

I couldn't comprehend how hiding like this would help. So, I just huddled in a corner with a cabinet next to me.

Then I heard a variety of noises, and before I could react or see anything, I felt something passing through the air. This was followed by cries and screams. The curtain hiding the plump woman moved slightly, and then she was gone. There was silence for a moment, and I saw two or three people emerging from their hiding spots, but I couldn't see the man who had crawled under the table. Everyone exchanged glances with a hint of unease on their faces. In my mind, I was desperately trying to figure out how not to be found. I was clearly more conspicuous than the plump woman, yet she was the one attacked and disappeared, along with the man under the table. How did "they" even discover them? Could it be unrelated to visual or perspectival factors?


As I pondered, the entire scene changed, and I found myself on unfamiliar streets. It was a crowded street reminiscent of the old Shanghai Bund, bustling with people.

The alarm sounded again, and everyone started running, but I couldn't discern a common direction. A girl ran past me, and I silently followed her. She asked, "Why are you following me?" I replied that I didn't even know why we were running. She explained, "Each time we pass a level, the creatures attacking us gain an additional dimension. The recent ones were two-dimensional beings, so they didn't have the same visual trajectory randomness as us. Now, with three-dimensional beings, they can move and observe in the entire space just like us. We really need to hide well. Just endure for 10 minutes."

We ran desperately and took refuge in the ruins behind a half-Western-style building. The structure was complex, and I thought that if we weren't attacked, we might be crushed by the ruins. We traversed the rubble, staying in places where the sunlight couldn't reach us, listening to the fading noise from the street. Through a crack in the wall next to me, I caught a glimpse of the strange creatures moving rapidly in the street. There seemed to be fewer of them than the objects that had passed through the air earlier, but they looked more terrifying because I could see their bizarre shapes. The girl next to me held her breath, waiting for the creature on the other side of the building to move on.


Ten minutes later, the scene changed again.

The girl and I were in a small town with many Huizhou-style buildings and some ordinary houses. However, there were very few people. The girl told me that the previous round of attacks had probably claimed many lives. The creatures that arrived this time were even higher-dimensional than us, almost unimaginable! I recalled my meager theoretical knowledge; this meant that in their eyes, there was no concept of internal space in the three-dimensional world. It was pointless to hide anywhere. I told the girl about this, and she said, "There's no other way; it always comes to this. We can only rely on luck and run randomly."

The alarm sounded again, and we rushed toward a row of similarly structured two-story houses, circling to the back. Many kitchens and dining rooms were located on the ground floor behind these houses. There was a peaceful countryside scene with ponds, water pipes, and kitchen gardens, but there was no one around us except for the girl. As we entered one of the rooms, I saw something that didn't pass through the door but simply went through the wall, as if the wall didn't exist for it. I knew we were surely doomed. I grabbed the girl and we ran out of the house. We chose a random direction and ran as fast as we could. I could feel those things were very close to us, but they hadn't attacked yet. The girl said she couldn't run anymore and let go of my hand. I didn't dare to look back!

I imagined a frantic point moving on a blank sheet of paper, and I tried to touch it with my finger.

That's probably what I looked like facing those high-dimensional creatures, desperately moving randomly.

I felt surrounded and decided to just run headlong into something.

At that moment, I heard a mocking voice coming from an unknown source: "Hey, stop running. You're the last one left, and everyone else has become the pursuers. We're tired of playing. Let us catch you, it's fine."

I stopped in confusion.



Then, I returned to the reality of the dream. It turned out that I had put on a helmet to play a virtual game. 

My friends said, "This damn game didn't even explain the rules to the participants! We volunteers were divided into two groups. 
In the first round, one group became one-dimensional beings, and the other remained in the three-dimensional world.
Those point trajectories were completely random. However, their movement was fast.
Half of the people in the three-dimensional world were hit.
Do you know what happens when you're hit? You become one of the pursuers!
Those who didn't get attacked by the pursuers became the pursued.
So, there was an equal exchange, roughly one-to-one.
But in the second round, you probably transitioned from being a pursuer in the first round to
being pursued in the second round.
Many pursuers in the second round failed to attack anyone because some people who had experienced 
the first round were more cautious. Although it was a face trajectory attack and the speed was
slower than the previous line trajectory attack, you still made it through the second round.
In the second round, almost everyone who didn't successfully attack became three-dimensional 
beings in the third round. This time, they had vision, but their attack speed decreased a bit.
With vision, their accuracy increased, and all the pursuers attacked.
Several of us also became pursuers in the fourth round.
By then, there were very few people left in the three-dimensional world.
Finally, we realized that almost everyone had become pursuers or had just been attacked, 
except for you, who was still desperately running.
Only when you become a pursuer do you regain your full memory.
This is an inhumane rule designed to make the pursued try their best to escape.
Hey, are you okay? Are you scared?" 

I was simply too tired to answer and finally woke up from the dream into the real reality.
