# Dream Ideas

## Ice Wonderland
Oh I had a few dreams last night. One of them is as usual an wonderland dream but in an ice wonderland. Everything was made of ice and lit by colourful lights. I tried the ice tunnel, the ice long slide, the ice train, the ice car

And there is big parade, where we all hop on and off the ice small train open cabin (there are people wearing shining costumes throwing ice like candies to the crowd. And some cabins are carrying different types of snow/ice )

## Jail in Germany

Another one is: I was in jail in Germany. Because in Germany if you break out and get caught again you won’t be punished, i was quite passionate about breaking out. I found a pal and we two were working hard on the plans.

In Germany your sentence won’t be prolonged if you broke out and sent back

In the explanation of the law: it’s in our nature that we all want to break out for freedom
