# Edward

In the dream:

I was biking on a narrow road across a narrow arch in my hometown. My view was very limited so I almost hit someone walking in front, I fell from the bike while trying to avoid that pedestrian.

I managed to lean on the wall of the arch without falling down. That guy was startled and turned around. He was Edward in his 17 year old look. And I realized I am back to my 16ish, so the year should be 2009. 

I had a mixed feeling facing the 17 year old Edward. It was nice and touching to see someone who were very endearing to me and whom I haven’t seen for more than 10 years. I didn’t know how to react either. I can’t remember clearly what happened at that specific time in real life (I didn’t realize I was dreaming I thought my soul did some strange time travel). I didn’t want to make things complicated, I just want to behave like me in that right time. 

I was thinking really hard. Were us friends? Did we fight? Did we start our crappy relationship? Did he betray me? We had such complex history with fighting happened every a few days! How am I supposed to know?! 

He didn’t give me the chance to think about how to react normally. He went straight to me and gave me the tightest hug. It felt like the one he gave me in real life once when he tried to convince me not to leave him. He held me like I was some missing part of his body and he just tried to merge me back to him. It was kinda hard to breath nor think. Then he tried to kiss me, and the atmosphere was getting out of control. I stopped him and told him I am not her.

I told him that I was from 2023, 12 years after we broke up in 2011(which is 2 years in the future). He was not surprised. He said he was from 2010, and we just had a huge fight and we were in a cold battle. He said it was not the first time he had this sort of soul time travel but it was the first time he saw me. The other travels he had were all to the future so he knew I would never be in his life in the future. He told me that he had really missed me. He had tried to look for me in his future life when he travelled to it but he can’t find me anywhere. 

I told him that not long after we broke up in 2011 when we were in two different universities in Wuhan (we also broke up a few times before this last one), I got sick quite badly for like two month and I lost my phone. I was not allowed to use any electric devices for my recovery, I still managed to send him a message on social media using desktop when my parents didn’t notice. But I never received his reply after days, so I blocked and deleted him from all the social media. When I fully recovered and got a new phone, I got a new number and told all of my friends Edward and I were done forever. After listening to what I said, he could not say anything for a while. Because what I said was something was in his future and he didn’t know. Then he felt it was almost the end of his soul time travel, he urged me to tell him my phone number in 2023, saying he would remember the number with his mind and call me when he live to 2023. I smiled with tears and told him a fake one. Because I knew, he would not call, and I hated waiting.
