# Lost Dogs and Secret Spaces

Yesterday, I walked a lot in Central Park, right? And saw many dogs. Then last night, I dreamed that there was a big park inside the UW campus, with an inconspicuous bench. Lately, there have been many posts about lost dogs at school, some have been missing for months without being found.

When I got tired from walking, I just happened to see that bench, so I sat down. Since there was no one around, I took off my shoes and put my feet on the bench to check my sore heels. Then I noticed that the scenery behind the bench (the direction my head was facing before I turned around) seemed different from when I arrived... Although it was still trees, they were denser, but there were also sparser areas, and a path leading to an open space. It was hard to notice because people sitting on the bench wouldn't normally look behind and notice the quietly changed landscape.

So, I climbed over the bench into this different space, and then I saw two or three lost dogs! They were the dogs lost from the campus!

I hurriedly took out my phone wanting to inform one of the dog's owners. I didn't recognize the other dogs, but I knew one of them was Jessica's. However, there was no signal in that different space, so I had to leave the area to find a signal. I tried to take Jessica's dog with me, but it wouldn't follow me.

After I told Jessica, I waited for her elsewhere on campus, and she hurried over. But I couldn't find that different space again. We anxiously circled the nearby area again and again but couldn't find it, though I indeed saw that dilapidated bench again.

So, I sat down on it trying to repeat what happened before. As soon as I sat down, two seconds later, Jessica exclaimed and told me to look back quickly. Then we climbed over the bench and went in, and she used dog treats to call the dogs, leading them all out. At the same time, I took a closer look at this place, feeling that the path's direction and the distribution of the trees were very similar to my hair...

Then I let Jessica sit down, and found that the space was different again, the trees became shorter and thicker. Different from the straight, thin fir trees when I sat down.

After discovering this secret, I asked jc to sit on the bench, and it turned very much like a park, with many round trees, some bushes, and a lot of open space lol. In the end, we happily played frisbee there.
