# Super Power

I had a dream last night.
In the dream I have a super power which is not very useful
I can choose a day to feel the feelings I experienced or will experience (not what I think just feel)
So if I choose to feel the feelings of  different day, then from 12 to 12 my current feelings will be tuned down and I will majorly feel that chosen day
So in the dream I decided to use it for forecasting. I was still an undergrad student in the dream.
An important exam was approaching and I was very anxious.
I wanted to know if I would do well.
But I don‚Äôt want to experience the exam feelings at all.
I chose to feel the day after!
I chose a day when I didn‚Äôt have any plans at all to experience it. (It would be very weird and confusing if I was with other people doing social activities).
And the feeling is very chill and peaceful.
I figured that I would do well in the exam.
So I also chilled out in the rest days before the exam. However when the exam came and it was hard as hell. And I knew for sure I was doomed.
The following day I felt even worse  because I realized I did so poor for i didn‚Äôt prepare!
I hated the regretful feelings so I chose a good day from the past to feel to over write my frustration.
Yeah that‚Äôs when I realized how useless my super power is.
Yup yup, without strict rules it can't be used easily!
I thought it was a powerful thing!
I thought I would be a prophet
It turned out seen from others I was just a dummy who didn‚Äôt study and failed exam ü•≤
You're definitely no dummy! It's a clever way to use the power! But it's quite tricky to use!
You would have to arrange it so you never overwrite certain days of the week
Then you have looking days, days you can use to experience emotions from the past or present 
And then feeling days where you actually experience today's emotions 
Wow
You come up with a system right away!
In my dream when I realized of my dream I didn‚Äôt get much clue
Hehehe, that's my super power üòÅ
I'd be able to use it to play the stock market, amass power and influence, change the world
