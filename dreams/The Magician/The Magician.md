# The Magician

I dreamed of a woman magician. People don’t know her at all.
Usually she shows up as one of two famous male magicians
Those two are both her fake images/ids
False identity
And people don’t know those two are the same person at all. And it’s understandable that Magicians don’t show up together
But she herself is the two most famous magicians
Heheh
She just use two different sets of tricks and two different styles to perform
Usually before her show, she just walk into the building as a nobody. So even people want to meet the two magicians before or after stage, they can’t
And she love to watch people’s comments arguing who is the better magitian
I watched one of the shows in a dining room of a big house.
And she was showing how to make fire out of her hand and cook with the other hand
That show was in Florence and she dressed up one of the ID into typical Italian chief hehehe
While we were all looking at the magician’s hands with full attention; another guy walked in with a violin. He started to play the white violin and we all turn our head into that direction.
And I looked back to the chief magian but he is gone.
And the window is open. Then I look back at the guy walked in, he sent out many pigeons while he was playing
He was the other ID
He looks younger and slimmer than the chief magician
The pigeons flew out of the room through the open window where the first magician disappeared
He was like a narcissistic beautiful teenager boy with very elegant classy behaviour
And his fans are almost all young women who love the way he looks and how he interacted with them.
After he used violin to get the crowd attention and pigeons to cover the chief magician to leave
He started his own show.
He started with flirting with one of the women audience but offering to play one piece for her. And while he plays we all focus on his hands
And we were thinking there is no way he has a third hand to do the magic
However after he finished playing and bent to kiss the hand of the lady. We noticed that there was a fresh flower on the lady’s hair out of nowhere
The play was still a distraction
I forgot how I found out her identity
I just got feeling and I walked to a woman who left the building with the audience
She has short hair and kinda tall, dressed in normal clothes hardly to notice
I gave her back the food the first magician cooked
And she looked surprised
And I told her in low voice that thee  music was very nice played
Then we walked and talked together
Talking about my next trip plan and she talks about her new magic ideas
We separated afterwards. This is just one part of my dream.
It was about many of my old friends in the rest of my dreams
It was raining last night
And I was waken up by it quite often
Hehehehe
Ohh I forgot to mention that the woman magician said she can carry way more stuff when she pretends to be a guy. She can use the space in the clothes!
