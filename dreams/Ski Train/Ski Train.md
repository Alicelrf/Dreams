# Ski Train

The dream I had last night was a bit anxious
I was on a ski trip with a few Waterloo friends
We went to big big mountains
We got the city by air and then got on a train with our luggages
Then the train keeps going up the hills after hills
It is very cold in that high altitude and the train need to constantly moving, otherwise it may not start again
So, there is no train station for transit in that area
Trains will go side by side closely with doors open and matches for a minute or so for travellers to transit
So all of us was quite busy with moving our stuff during the transition minute from on train to another
And after I moved my last luggage I went back to check if I have anything left
Well I didn’t l, but when I got back to the door it was closed..I missed the transition
And I got nothing with me
I asked the crew what I can do. They said I need to take the next transit which will bring me to the same destination
Snowpiercer?
Ah I think I watched the first one
And I did successfully made it to another train. However, I made to a wrong half. The first and second half will separate and head to a different destination…
And I asked the crew for help again..this time they put me off at a real train station
And I had a hard time going through my many pockets for my IDs
I only got a credit card and my snow ticket lol
That’s the only two I carry with me
Because I don’t want to lost more important cards based on my records lol
Well the crew was not very hard on me.
They put me on the right train again
I did end up reunite with my friends
And I did some skiing in my dream over the big big hills
The hills are sooo high up in the sky
I could see myself skiing like a cartoon character
It’s actually more like a game I played before
Alto’s adventure
It’s a beautiful and soothing game
