# Hero Dogs

According to a historic document, a large library located in a remote village in ancient China was destroyed by a fire hundreds of years ago.
And in the document it says most books were lost after the fire. People just assumed the books were all eaten by fire. But we the antique saver are going to save the books from past.
My colleague and I brought two well trained working dogs with us and time travelled to the village.
During the day we pretend to be business people travelled there trading stuff with the locals. And we made some friends.
At night, we sneaked into the library and filled our folded special boxes with important books.
We didn’t really know when the fire would happen exactly
So we worked hard trying to save as much as we can.
Those boxes are strong and water/fire proofed. The dogs helped with book transport and guard the environment.
One day my colleague and I were half drunk after grabbed a few drinks with the locals. He is working deeply inside the library picking out books, while I just packed one box closer to the entrance.
I heard someone approaching but strangely the dogs were quiet. I was just curious about what was out there.
I went out of the library following the origin of the sound with a gun in my hand.
But I didn’t see anyone or anything. So I headed back to the library.
Just when I got closer to the entrance, I heard yelling, fighting and shooting in the library. I tried to quietly ran towards where I thought my colleague was.
But I saw him lying on the floor and a person looks familiar standing there. I pointed my gun at him (yeah I am a guy in this dream) requesting him to drop his weapon. But he turned around facing me carelessly with some trace of anger. He is definitely me from the future!
I was astonished to see the strange and familiar face. And he dragged my colleague’s body and time travelled back to the future. Left me without saying anything.
After that night, I stopped hanging out with the locals. I was avoiding them because I didn’t know how to answer the questions about the missing of my colleague.
I just grab drinks and drink it in the library.
I stopped working on saving the books. Just wanted to drink my problem away. The dogs were also traumatized. They missed my colleague and didn’t understand what happened.
But without instructions the dogs kept working on packing books into box and shipped them to the future after collecting a few.
Not long after the murder, one night when I was drunk and lying on the floor of the library. I was waken up by the dogs. They anxiously barked and bites my hands. Even tried to drag me through pulling my clothes.
I woke up and saw fire aggressively approaching me.
With the help of the dogs I stranded up and ran for my life.
I brought the rest boxes and dogs back to the future feeling pretty ashamed.
