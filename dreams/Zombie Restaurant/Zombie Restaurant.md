# Zombie Restaurant

In the dream I was travelling across desert with a few strangers, random people. We were a group of casual tourists, and maybe fancying ourselves as explorers.

We took a coach bus to a small city in the oasis.

It seemed like a cute multi-cultural place, with only one Main Street. There was not much to see, just some coffee shops, hand crafts shops and restaurants. I don’t know if was just a bad day for tourism or so, but most of the stores seem to be closed recently.

We could only manage some light window shopping, we were bored in no time. Then one of us found an open restaurant and we all agreed it was a good idea to have some food and drink. When we got in, there were no other patrons, and the owner looked a little too enthusiastic about our arrival.

I should have picked up on that hint, seen through that guise! Because soon after we'd finished our food, we noticed it had turned dark outside and the owner was nowhere to be found.

Then all of a sudden the walking dead!! Many appeared seemingly out oft thin air as they tried to get into the restaurant and panic gripped tight to our hearts!

We tried to fight against them and also tried to blocked the door with chairs and tables, but it quickly became clear that we were trapped in that restaurant!

Just as we were trying our luck with the last possible way out, some guy stepped out and said he has magic power and knows how to form a restraining barrier for the walking dead. He would restrict them to the side walk, so that we could use the street to get outside of the city where hopefully we could find a Jeep. However, for this to work, he would need our help to maintain the effects of his spell.

So this is what he had us do: 

First, we needed to open the door and protect him while he walked out to the street. Then he would draw something to restrain the walking dead to the sidewalks. This would let us walk between the two opposing side walks. But his power was not strong enough to hold on for that long.

To maintain the effec, we needed to high five the walking dead while walking as fast as possible!!!

We didn’t have any better ideas, and our lives were on the line, so we followed his advice!

It was so slimy, gross and scary!

But I did my part.

I high fived so many of the shuffling and gibbering dead while walking at my fastest clip.

And when the street ended, the magic was over we all ran for our lives, hopped onto the Jeep and drove away!

As we caught our breath I noticed the guy looked amused and pretended to be scared as us!

I said: wait a minute, did you just trick us so that you could watch us high five all of those shambling terrors?

And he found us all furiously glaring at him!

We gave him a good lesson...
