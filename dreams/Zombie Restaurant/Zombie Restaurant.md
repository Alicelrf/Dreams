# Zombie Restaurant

In the dream I was travelling across desert with a few strangers, random people. We are a group of casual tourists maybe a bit of explorers as well.
We took travel bus to a small city in the oasis
It’s a cute multi culture place, with only one Main Street. There is not much to see, just some coffee shops, hand crafts shops and restaurants. I don’t know if we were there on a bad day or so, but most of the stores seem to be closed recently.
We could only do some window shopping and got bored in no time. Then one of us found an open restaurant and we all agreed to have some food and drink. There were no other clients in the restaurant. And the owner looked kinda too enthusiastic about us arriving.
Yeah I should have seen that sign. Because after we had our food. We noticed it turned dark outside and we couldn’t find the owner anymore.
Then all of a sudden there appears many walking dead!! They tried to get into the restaurant and we were panic!
We tried to fight against them and also tried to blocked the door with chairs and tables
We were trapped in the restaurant!
Right when we were running out of the ways. Some guy stepped out and said he has magic power and knows how to restrain the walking dead to the side walk so that we can use the street to walk out side of this city where we can find a Jeep. But he needs our help to maintain the effects.
So this is what he led us to do: first we need to open the door and protect him walking out to the street. Then he will draw something to restrain the walking deads to the sidewalks. Then we can come out and walk between the side walks. But his power is not strong enough to hold on that long
This is what we need to do to maintain the effect
We need to high five with the walking deads and keep walking as fast as possible
We didn’t have better ideas than what he offered. So we followed his advice.
It was so slimy, gross and scary
But I did my part
I high fives with so many walking dead’s while walking as fast as I could
And when the street ended the magic was over we all ran for our lives
And got on the Jeep and drove away
Then when we caught up our breath I noticed the guy looked amused and pretended to be scared as us
I said: wait a minute, did you just trick us to high five with them?
And he found us all looking at him madly
We gave him a good lesson
