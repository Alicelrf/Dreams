# Super Underwear

A: I invented a new underwear in my dream lol. It has a few buttons. One for vibration ðŸ˜‚, one for ventilation, one for cooling down, one for water gun (used for mischief but you donâ€™t really want to shoot your pee

J: Woaaaaah 
J: Vibration? ðŸ˜³
J: I would definitely be using the ventilation button 
J: I always run too hot!

A: And a water gun! ðŸ˜‚

J: Amazing 
J: Sign me up for the first pair! 
J: Is the vibration function used for what I think it is? ðŸ˜³

A: Lol what else do you think it can be used for?

J: Hahaha you never know! I gotta remember it's Alice's dreams I'm dealing with here, the ultimate font of creativity!
J: But in that case I would definitely try that function too ðŸ˜³

A: I didnâ€™t get to give you all the details of the dream this morning
A: In my dream I was giving a presentation for the new underwear product lol
A: I was holding one sample to demonstrate the functionality

A: There are other functions like: colour change to show the inner side temperature; to seal and collect some bad odor when itâ€™s not the right case to release it; also to release it to a certain direction as a weapon
A: When the butt is over a healthy temperature it will turn red, when I hold it in my hand it is a light pink colour
A: Yeah I was doing a business presentation in my dream because that was what I was practicing before I went to bed lol
A: No difference lol

J: Whaaaaaat timed bad odor release? Temperature sensitivity?
J: Amazing!
J: I kinda wish it existed now! I would definitely buy a pair lol

A: Heheh, itâ€™s is not a standalone product. In the era of my dream. Underwear is a sub-module of a suit.
A: It needs to be integrated to the whole suit product
A: Heheh, I definitely did too much engineering work yesterday
A: So the whole sonnet quote product is like the suit, while what I am doing is the underwear sub module lol.

J: Oh wow! 
J: Hahaha I think so!
J: I wonder what drew you to the underwear ðŸ¤”
J: Either way, it's the most creative underwear I've ever heard of!
