# Narcissistic Weak Virus - Narcissus

Narcissus Generation Zero [COVID Omicron variant]
* First discovered in 2024, the first ERV (Endogenous Retrovirus) to truly coexist with humans.
* Symptoms: All of humanity carries it without symptoms. Post-effects were first discovered in 2029.

Narcissus Generation One [Naming is Really Hard 1]
* First discovered in 2027
* Symptoms: Mild cases often have intermittent hallucinations. Most infected recover within a week. After recovery, most mild cases do not show the Narcissus virus, but the Omicron variant remains. Severe cases may experience temporary memory loss, with some recovering their memory after some time. After recovery, almost no traces of Omicron or Narcissus are found. Those who don't recover show symptoms of excessive sleepiness and deep coma.
* Severe Treatment: Corticosteroid medications, electrical stimulation for deep awakening.
* Treatment Side Effects and Aftereffects: Patients wake up with memory and emotional disorders and resist treatment.
* Cutting-edge Treatment Research: Ongoing studies on hypnotherapy as an adjunct treatment; results are unclear.
* At-Risk Groups: Everyone is susceptible. Severe cases are more common in females, accounting for about 70%. Studies have shown that most severe cases had light sleep and frequent dreams, but some scholars question the sample size.

Narcissus Generation Two [Naming is Really Hard 2]
* First discovered in 2028
* Symptoms: Mild symptoms are similar to Generation One, but severe cases progress much faster. Severe cases suddenly fall into a deep coma, and to avoid misdiagnosing other diseases, PCR testing is crucial.
* Severe Treatment: Progressive targeted neural drugs TNR in phase one clinical trials, hypnotherapy in clinical trials.
* Side Effects and Aftereffects: Split personality.
* At-Risk Groups: Same as Narcissus Generation One.

Public Knowledge:
- In 2024, autopsies revealed that 100% of human brains tested had the COVID Omicron variant.
- In 2025, WHO declared that the COVID "king" variant Omicron was asymptomatic in all humans, coexisting permanently. What Omicron would do to humans remained unknown.
- In 2026, the new Narcissus virus was quietly born. Omicron is its ancestor.
- After invading the human body, the Narcissus virus communicates with the Omicron variant, causing short-lived hallucinations or uncontrollable memories.
- The reason for self-healing in mild cases: Within 24 hours after the Narcissus virus invades the human body, it can temporarily produce an immunosuppressive effect. If it doesn't create a strong hallucination or a new personality during this period, the immune system will defeat it or it will become dormant. If the hallucinations aren't strong enough, they are forgotten like dreams.

Confidential Knowledge:
- After the incubation period, the Narcissus virus uses the information collected by Omicron to try to create different humanoid hallucinations (protein particle stimuli) to communicate with the host's consciousness, inducing and reading memories.
- Interaction between the host's consciousness and the hallucinations produced by the virus allows the infected person's personality traits, memories, and vulnerabilities to be written into the virus's genetic material, mimicking the last host when infecting the next one.
- After a brief incubation period, the second-generation virus can invade the patient's brain, control the central nervous system causing deep coma, and create realistic large-scale hallucinations, making it difficult for the patient to distinguish between reality and illusion.
- Once the virus has created enough hallucinations for the patient to form strong emotional connections, it establishes a base in the body and takes priority in nutrients from the brain. The patient's consciousness is almost entirely under the virus's control, making it almost impossible for them to wake up.
- Both first and second-generation Narcissus viruses carry a large amount of RNA related to the previous host's personality, requiring a lot of energy to replicate and lacking quality RNA for replication. Thus, they only replicate twice.
- Replicated viruses leave the host through the respiratory system and spread through the air and droplets.
