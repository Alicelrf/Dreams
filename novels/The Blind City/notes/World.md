# Notes on the World

I also need to think about what I really want to express through the story.
Or do I really have anything so important to convey?
Right now I am more like just describing what my imagination brings to me.
Many of them don’t really have meaning at first then my reasoning take over it and give it a perspective.
For example in my initial imagination, the blind people have way sharp sense of smell and taste than non blind people.
There are two development after this setting.
One is, the blind people would tell two subspecies of a vege from the taste but non blind can’t.
One subspecies of the vege will change the smell of the consumer’s breath, sweat and urine.
And this smell will also only be detected by blind people.
During the period of time when these two people don’t trust each other.
The food supply chain controlled by some blind people will on purposely mix the two vegetable.
So all the non blind people can be easily sensed by the blind people.
